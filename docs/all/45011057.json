It serves as an intensive alternative to the standard English requirement, which generally takes two years and meets just once a week in large classes. <BR/>The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms.  Toward this end, there is a focus on communication and interaction in class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively. <BR/>Active all-English participation is required for success in this course, and at the end of IE-II, students of all sections are expected to have developed a degree of conversational confidence and competence well-beyond that of their average colleague.", "授業方法": "For AY 2022/2023 the plan is to teach face-to-face in the classroom with precautions to prevent the spread of covid. However, if the covid situation worsens there is a possibility that classes may be moved to partially or wholly online. The teacher will update you at that time in detail if that happens but in general classes would use Zoom, Luna, and other online tools.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["All course meetings are planned to be face-to-face.<BR/>Course Orientation.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第2回": ["On Task 3 Unit 10<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第3回": ["On Task 3 Unit 11<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第4回": ["On Task 3 Unit 12<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第5回": ["Final Textbook Test.<BR/>Review questions from units 1-9<BR/>Main questions from units 10-12.", "3 hours."], "第6回": ["Introduction of XReading<BR/>Introduction of reading circles.<BR/>Mid-term speaking test.<BR/>Mid-term journal check.<BR/>Mid-term vocabulary test.", "3 hours."], "第7回": ["Reading and discussion using XReading.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第8回": ["Reading and discussion using XReading.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第9回": ["Reading and discussion using XReading.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第10回": ["Reading and discussion using XReading.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第11回": ["Reading and discussion using XReading.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第12回": ["Reading and discussion using XReading.<BR/>Basic vocabulary study.<BR/>Basic speaking practice.<BR/>Basic writing practice.<BR/>Basic listening practice.", "3 hours."], "第13回": ["Final speaking test practice with peers.<BR/>Final speaking test with teacher.<BR/>Final journal check.", "3 hours."], "第14回": ["Final vocabulary test.<BR/>Class review.<BR/>Make up tests as needed.<BR/>Feedback from students to the teacher.", "2 hours."]}, "評価": {"教科書/Required texts0": ["著者名\nAuthor", "タイトル\nTitle", "発行所\nPublisher", "出版年\nYear of Publication", "ISBN", "ボタン\nButton"], "教科書/Required texts1": ["Harris and Leeming", "On Task 3", "Abax", "2018 年", "97817854738", ""], "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["その他／Others (99)", "100 %", "See detailed note below."], "成績評価Grading2": "備考　Note\nVocabulary tests 20%\nSpeaking tests 20%\nTextbook test 20%\nWriting journal 20%\nReading activities 20%", "更新日時/Date of Update0": "2022年02月15日 22時57分04秒", "項番No.0": [], "項番No.1": ["2022年度", "春学期／Spring", "月曜３時限／Monday 3", "春学期／Spring", "Ｇ－２０８"], "項番No.2": ["2022年度", "春学期／Spring", "水曜４時限／Wednesday 4", "春学期／Spring", "Ｇ－２２６"], "項番No.3": ["2022年度", "春学期／Spring", "金曜２時限／Friday 2", "春学期／Spring", "Ｇ－２０４"]}, "campas": 0, "name": "【200】インテンシブ・イングリッシュ　５７／Intensive English", "管理部署": 20, "単位数": 3, "担当者": "ウィルキンス　Ｍ．（WILKINS MICHAEL） ", "履修基準年度": "１年", "緊急授業形態": 0, "オンライン授業形態": 2, "時限1": 2, "時限2": 17, "時限3": 29, "評価1": 4, "開講期": 1}
