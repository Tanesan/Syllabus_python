Especially in politics, it not only has three major political parties and independent legislative and judicial institutions, but also has a series of comprehensive auxiliary and monitoring systems such as small parties, lobby groups, and the media. At the same time, Australia's political structure is also constantly developing and changing against the background of today's rapidly changing and increasingly complex geopolitics and international situation. Based on the factors mentioned above, along the timeline, this course examines the Australia's development to the present from several different perspectives, such as, history, culture, diplomacy, digitization and globalization, and future trends.", "授業方法": "In order to allow students to experience and understand the content of the subject more deeply and comprehensively, some digital tools, group discussions and presentations will be adopted in the class to increase the interaction between participants, so that to deepen students' impressions and feelings about what they have learned.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction to geography, culture, history, science and technology of Australia", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第2回": ["A short political history of Australia and Australian political thought", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第3回": ["The Australian Federation: From colony to Commonwealth", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第4回": ["Foreign and defense policy of Australia", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第5回": ["Elections, the electoral system and the Australian voter", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第6回": ["Data-Driven Campaigning: A View from the Ground", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第7回": ["Follow the leader: Political leadership in Australia", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第8回": ["Parliaments of Australia and Executive government", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第9回": ["The origins and evolution of the major parties", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第10回": ["The minor parties and independents", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第11回": ["Gender and sexuality in Australian politics", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第12回": ["Government–business relations", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第13回": ["Indigenous politics and Multicultural Australia", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第14回": ["The Fourth Estate: News media in the digital age", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第15回": ["Religious communities and politics", "Review the lecture content by re-perusing the lecture resumes, materials and writing on the white board distributed in the class."], "第16回": ["A look back at the whole course and Conclusion", ""]}, "評価": {"0": "", "1": ["", ""], "2": ["", ""], "3": ["", ""], "4": ["", ""], "5": ["", ""], "6": ["", ""], "7": ["", ""], "8": ["", ""], "9": ["", ""], "10": ["", ""], "11": ["", ""], "12": ["", ""], "13": ["", ""], "14": ["", ""], "15": ["", ""], "16": ["", ""], "教科書Required texts0": "Not used.
