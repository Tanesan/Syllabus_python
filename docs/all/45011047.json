The class functions as a community in which the members support each other to express themselves and students must primarily communicate with the teacher and all students in English only. The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms. There is a focus on oral fluency development and interactive communication in every class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively.", "授業方法": "This course is centred mainly on discussions. Students will discuss their opinions and ideas in pairs and in small groups. Students will be involved in presentation discussions throughout the semester. Presentation discussions will be conducted in small groups. One individual in-class presentation will also be given by each student to the entire class. There will also be a focus on developing writing skills this semester.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["<br />Week 1 - Introductions: Course Explanation, Classroom Language, Technology Set-ups", "<div>Online setup if needed.</div><div>1 - 2 hours of outside class time prep for student surveys.<br /></div>"], "第2回": ["Week 2 - Topic 1: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第3回": ["Week 3 - Topic 1: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第4回": ["Week 4 - Topic 2: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第5回": ["Week 5 - Topic 2: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice.<br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第6回": ["Week 6 - Topic 3: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第7回": ["Week 7 - Topic 3: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第8回": ["Week 8 - Topic 4: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第9回": ["Week 9 - Topic 4: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus,Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice.", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第10回": ["Week 10 - Topic 5: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice.", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第11回": ["Week 11 - Topic 5: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice. <br />", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第12回": ["Week 12 - Topic 6: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Paragraph Writing Practice.", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第13回": ["Week 13 - Topic 6: Vocabulary Practice, Speaking Fluency Focus, Conversation and Discussion Activities, Group Presentations.", "2 - 3 hours per week<br />Detailed teacher feedback in written or prerecorded format will be given for each main assignment students complete for assessment and evaluation."], "第14回": ["Week 14 - Final Week: Reflection and Discussion.<br /><br />", ""], "授業計画1": "Note: This syllabus may be subject to revisions according to student needs and abilities.", "授業外学習2": "This is an all-English classroom.
