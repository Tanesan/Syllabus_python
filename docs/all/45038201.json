There will be a strong emphasis on group and pair work throughout. Practice tests (parts and whole) and vocabulary quizzes will be used. Active student interaction and participation is a strong expectation of this course. Currently, the intention is for this class to be taught face-to-face; adaptations may be made in light of changing conditions and university policies. Students are expected to follow safety protocols (i.e. wearing masks and respecting social distancing) during all face-to-face classes.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction to course<br />Overview of the TOEIC test.<br />Initial TOIEC Listening Practice Test (45 minutes)<br />Survey on TOEIC experiences, needs, and goals", "All 14 sessions to be conducted Face to Face.<br />Study target vocabulary.
