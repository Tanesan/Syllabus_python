{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One immediate purpose of this course is to build on what the\nstudents have learned individually from their experience of the Group Research\ncourse. Students also have the opportunity to choose and develop a research\ntopic and / or series of research questions that interest them most, drawing on\nthe full scope of IMC courses and on their individual experiences of work and\nstudy. Students should choose a research topic along with research questions\nand research objectives that demonstrate a clear relevance to current and\nemerging trends in international business and management practice. The research\ndesign should be conducted and delivered at a standard appropriate for\nMasters-level study. Ideally, individual students can use this course as an opportunity\nto become ‘expert’ in a particular aspect of business and management and thus\nimprove their options for future career and professional development.</p>", "到達目標": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The instructor as supervisor expects students to work\nresponsibly, ethically and with clear objectives in mind. The instructor as\nsupervisor will also encourage students to determine what type of ‘audience’\nthey intend to inform and enlighten with their research: e.g. what can managers\nin organisations, business investors or entrepreneurs learn from the student’s\nresearch process and findings? What contribution to current management and\nbusiness knowledge and practice can the student make with the processes and\nproducts of their individual research?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">On this basis, an overarching learning goal for this course\nis:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"JA\" 游明朝\",serif;mso-ascii-font-family:calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\"=\"游明朝',serif;mso-ascii-font-family:calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;mso-hansi-font-family:calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;'\" style=\"font-family:;\">•</span>By\nengaging actively and collaboratively with this course, individual students\nshould become confident in their roles and responsibilities as independently\nresourceful researchers.</p>", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Face-to-face", "トピック": {"第1回": ["<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The research proposal: process</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></p>", ""], "第2回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">The research proposal: product</span>", "<br /><div><span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Prepare an individual re-assessment of proposals written or discussed during the Group Research course.</span></div>"], "第3回": ["<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Research design: justification</p>", ""], "第4回": ["<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>The what, why and how of a critical literature review</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p><br /></o:p></p>", "<br /><div><span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Each IR student designates target 'audiences' for the research problem they are researching</span></div>"], "第5回": ["<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The researcher role: skills and competencies</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></p>", ""], "第6回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">The researcher role: performance (audience)</span>", "<br /><div><span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Students prepare to give a brief presentation in class about progress towards submitting a draft Thesis (non-assessed)</span></div>"], "第7回": ["<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Seminar: presenting a research proposal to a critical\naudience</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br /></p>", ""], "第8回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Instructor gives individual&nbsp;and group feedback on the individual&nbsp;presentations.</span>", "<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Students prepare a first draft of their dissertation outline&nbsp;</span>"], "第9回": ["<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Instructor offers and organizes individual tutorial slots for each student.&nbsp; responds to individual questions about the\nprocess and product of gathering and analyzing research data</p><br />", "<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Instructor responds to individual student queries about the final submission process.</span>"], "第10回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Instructor offers and organizes individual tutorial slots for each student.&nbsp; responds to individual questions about the process and product of gathering and analyzing research data</span>", ""], "第11回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Instructor offers and organizes individual tutorial slots for each student.&nbsp; responds to individual questions about the process and product of gathering and analyzing research data</span>", ""], "第12回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Instructor offers and organizes individual tutorial slots for each student.&nbsp; responds to individual questions about the process and product of gathering and analyzing research data</span>", ""], "第13回": ["Students give individual presentations based on the current state of their research design and implementation (assessed)", ""], "第14回": ["<span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">Instructor gives&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">individual</span><span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">&nbsp;and group feedback on the individual&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:11.0224px;\">presentations.</span>", "students begin the piloting and data gathering &amp; analyzing processes"]}, "評価": {"0": "", "1": ["", ""], "2": ["", ""], "3": ["", ""], "4": ["", ""], "5": ["", ""], "6": ["", ""], "7": ["", ""], "8": ["", ""], "9": ["", ""], "10": ["", ""], "11": ["", ""], "12": ["", ""], "13": ["", ""], "14": ["", ""], "教科書Required texts0": "There is no required text.
