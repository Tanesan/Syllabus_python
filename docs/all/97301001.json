Focusing on globalization and the complicated society where we live, the course will cover expanding range of issues in business ethics. The course will first take a look at the definition of “ethics”, the “glue” that makes sustainable business possible and successful, at its general significance in the business context. Focusing on the corporation’s responsibilities to its stakeholders and society as a whole, it will then cover topics from a variety of viewpoints examining each case at the ethical implications of managerial decisions. Thus, the course enables students to see how all of the issues presented are interrelated and are emerging as strategic imperatives for corporations.", "到達目標": "As a result of this course students will be able to:<br />- demonstrate a practical understanding of the three components of corporate responsibility, outlining the corporation’s responsibility to the environment, to society, and to consumers<br />- embrace the role of ethics and philanthropy as it relates to corporate responsibility<br />- determine how to communicate and implement corporate responsibility programs strategically and effectively.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "All lectures are conducted completely face-to-face.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction: Students demonstrate a practical understanding of  an overall plan for the course.

We will explore the benefits and risks of AI, the tensions between capitalism, responsible AI, and corporate governance, and discuss the importance of responsible AI for business leaders, regulators, and society.

In the 90’s before the dawn of CSV era, corporate philanthropy was quite popularly practiced among companies, and now corporate philanthropy works most effectively when it builds on core business operations and strategic imperatives. Although it is difficult to define the right metrics, it is essential to measure the progress and success of corporate philanthropy programs in order to build and support the business case for corporate philanthropy to sometimes skeptical stakeholders.", "Students are required to read the following case and the assigned chapters in the course textbook, Argenti, P.A.
