Students will study examples of expressive writing in the genre of personal essay, creative non-fiction/essay, with brief explorations in short fiction and hybrid writing, and will become familiar with the techniques that authors use to write effective pieces. Students will then apply these techniques in generating their own original pieces. In doing so, students will come to understand more deeply the structure of English on the sentence level and on the paragraph level. Students will also increase their mastery of English by exploring metaphor and other types of figurative language, skills which will cross over to help them write livelier pieces in their academic careers. Practice writing descriptions will encourage students to observe carefully and be able to effectively convey their observations and analysis in English. Additionally, students will practice collaborative writing with fellow students. Students will also be responsible for reading the work of classmates and making useful and constructive comments about these pieces. This course will allow students to increase competence, comfort, and pleasure in their use of English.", "授業方法": "This course will have three main components: lectures, class discussions of example writing pieces, and pair or group work as students read one another’s original writing pieces and comment.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Lecture: What is expressive writing?
