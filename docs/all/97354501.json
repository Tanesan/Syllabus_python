{"履修期": "春学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "The purpose of this course is to guide students towards developing an international management (IM) perspective on current and emerging challenges and opportunities in the global business environment. Specifically, we discuss processes of international management (IM) as a strategic organisational response to these challenges and opportunities. We structure our discussion around real-life examples of IM practice in a variety of organisation types: multi-national and transnational corporations (MNCs &amp; TNCs), small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and micro-enterprises seeking to do business internationally. We explore and discuss examples from a range of business sectors, where organisations are competing internationally, for profit and not-for-profit. Recognising that much research and discussion of IM continues to demonstrate a ‘western’ bias, we develop our discussion from an East Asian perspective. We use case studies in order to illustrate and examine how and why practices of IM in Japanese, Chinese and Korean businesses are shaping flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) across emerging and so-called developed markets worldwide: e.g. in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and in Europe.", "到達目標": "y participating actively and collaboratively on this course, each student should become more able to:<BR/><BR/>- Demonstrate a critical appreciation of the roles and responsibilities exercised by IM practitioners in organisations generally, and specifically in geographical locations and markets across Asia <BR/><BR/>- Formulate - and justify - strategic decisions that IM practitioners might make in order to render their organisations more competitive in international markets for business<BR/><BR/>- Apply tools and techniques relevant towards developing a career in international management and international business leadership, including the creation and management of micro-enterprises designed strategically to compete internationally.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "Management; Cross-cultural management; Organisational Behaviour", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Lectures (in-class and, if necessary, on-line); om-line (LUNA) discussions", "トピック": {"第1回": ["International management: roles and responsibilities (co-ordination and control)", ""], "第2回": ["Case study discussion", "Home study exercises designed to guide students towards working effectively as a group and individually"], "第3回": ["Scanning the international business environment: uncertainty and risk", ""], "第4回": ["Case study discussion", "Practical examples of business environmental scanning"], "第5回": ["Organisational management: differentiation and integration", ""], "第6回": ["Case study discussion", "Selected chapters and exercises from the textbook (LUNA discussion)"], "第7回": ["Organisational leadership: diversity and conflict", ""], "第8回": ["Case study discussion", "Selected chapters and exercises from the textbook (LUNA discussion)"], "第9回": ["International management: emerging business challenges and opportunities", ""], "第10回": ["Case study discussion", "Selected chapters and exercises from the textbook (LUNA discussion)"], "第11回": ["Group presentations (assessed)", ""], "第12回": ["Instructor gives feedback on the group presentations<BR/><BR/>Instructors gives briefing about the team assignment", "Selected chapters and exercises from the textbook.
