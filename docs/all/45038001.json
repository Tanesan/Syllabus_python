Students who have completed the necessary documents and have been accepted by the university to take online classes instead of Face-to-Face classes must attend all classes live on Zoom. The teacher will contact students directly and give them the Zoom links through student KGU e-mail addresses. ONLY students who have permission from KGU to take online classes can use Zoom for the lessons, all other students need to attend classes regularly. <BR/><BR/>Email the teacher at mjchang@kwansei.ac.jp to get the Google Classroom site code to register.<BR/><BR/>**If classes are to be held online, all classes will be live using Zoom for synchronous style classes.<BR/>------<BR/>This is an all-English classroom.
