{"履修期": "秋学期集中", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course focuses on the subject of multiculturalism, how to think about the issues and learn about the diverse phenomena that occur within societies that are composed of plural communities and ethnic identities. Students will be introduced to key concepts, such as, \"culture,\" \"ethnicity,\" \"diaspora\" and \"prejudice/discrimination.\" Also, considerations of the \"modern\" nature of multicultural consciousness, and the local ramifications brought about by global trends, especially the movement of people across national borders will be studied.", "到達目標": "At the end of the course, students should have a basic understanding of what defines multicultural/plural societies. They will have been introduced to concepts of \"culture\" and cultural dynamics, ethnicity and inter-cultural relations. Through the assignments and group presentation activities they will be required to hone critical thinking skills and be more aware of the importance of distinguishing appropriate methods for analyzing problems and when/when not to apply them. It is hoped they will be better equipped to apply what they learn in their respective fields of study and in the future when they find themselves faced with various socio-cultural situations and problems.", "特記事項": "本授業科目は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”ではありません。 The course is not subject to the 60-credit limit for online courses.", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "In accordance to KGU guidelines (at the time of this submission) classes will be conducted by in-classroom Face to face format.
