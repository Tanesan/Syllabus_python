{"履修期": "秋学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "The purpose of this course is for the student to understand the broad range of concepts and techniques concerned with risk management and controls, some of which may be quantified, while others may be treated in a more subjective manner. Financial Risk Management combines innovative analytical methods with traditional risk management processes and new approaches for managing risk by corporations.\nWe will focus on the following six risks and the risk management: (1) market risk (2) foreign exchange risk (3) interest rate risk (4) credit risk (5) securitization risk, and (6) catastrophe risk. Using theoretical application with case studies, we will learn how risk management can increase a firm’s value and how risk controls and the techniques can accomplish an organization’s specific risk management objectives.", "到達目標": "Students will understand the broad range of concepts and techniques related to risk management and controls, some of which may be quantified, while others may be treated in a more subjective manner.
