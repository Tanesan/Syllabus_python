Students are expected to use English in class as much as possible. This course will require students to read about a variety of topics in English, which will hopefully be of interest to them and encourage them to enjoy reading in English more. Students will also be required to take part in pair and group discussions to discuss what the text meant and their ideas related to it. In addition to the textbook, other supplementary materials will be used related to the topics and students will be expected to choose and read books that interest them outside of class as homework. There will be a focus on vocabulary building with possible vocabulary quizzes. The instructor will help students develop reading strategies that will increase their comprehension ability.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Week 1; Introduction to course", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第2回": ["Week 2: Reading 1 preview", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第3回": ["Week 3: Reading 1 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 2 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第4回": ["Week 4: Reading 2 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 3 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第5回": ["Week 5: Reading 3 discussion and expansion&nbsp;<div>Reading 4 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第6回": ["Week 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading 4 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 5 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第7回": ["Week 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading 5 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 6 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第8回": ["Week 8: Reading 6 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 7 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第9回": ["Week 9: Reading 7 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 8 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第10回": ["Week 10: Reading 8 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 9 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第11回": ["Week 11:Reading 9 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 10 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第12回": ["Week 12: Reading 10 discussion and expansion<div>Reading 11 preview</div>", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第13回": ["Week 13: Reading 11 discussion and expansion", "Approximately 1 hour to 90 minutes per week."], "第14回": ["Week 14: Course review", ""], "授業計画1": "This syllabus outline may be subject to revisions according to student needs and abilities.", "授業外学習2": "This course builds on each previous lesson.
