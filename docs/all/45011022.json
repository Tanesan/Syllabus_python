The class functions as a community in which the members support each other to express themselves and students must primarily communicate with the teacher and all students in English only. The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms. There is a focus on oral fluency development and interactive communication in every class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively. Students will need to communicate and speak with each other interactively during all lessons. The main focus of this course is spoken fluency development.", "授業方法": "All lessons will be conducted on campus (face-to-face style). Google Classroom will be used for some assignment information and submissions, and also for regular contact with the teacher. Students need a Google account. This information will be explained in detail during the first lesson. This course is centered mainly on discussions. Students will discuss their opinions and ideas in pairs and in small groups. Students will be involved in presentations and discussions throughout the semester. <BR/>*INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS PERMITTED TO TAKE CLASSES ONLINE: Students who have completed the necessary documents and have been accepted by the university to take online classes instead of Face-to-Face classes must attend all classes live on Zoom. The teacher will contact students directly and give them the Zoom links through student KGU e-mail addresses. ONLY students who have permission from KGU to take online classes can use Zoom for the lessons, all other students need to attend classes regularly.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["“All 42 sessions are conducted Face to face”<BR/>Week 1: Course Introduction - General course information.
