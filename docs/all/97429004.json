{"履修期": "春学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This seminar provides a practical introduction to processes of social scientific research applied in contexts for international business and management research. The emphasis is on the practical steps and decisions that students need to take and justify in order to produce a comprehensive and convincing research proposal. <BR/><BR/>The seminar offers training in the discourse (spoken &amp; written) of international research. It gives students practice in preparation for presenting their research proposal orally to a critical and international audience of potential research supervisors. <BR/><BR/>Specifically, the seminar is designed to improve students’ skills and confidence relevant to identifying defining a research topic or ‘problem’, conducting a critical literature review, formulating research questions and objectives, formulating and implementing a research strategy and plan, selecting and justifying research methods, analysing, interpreting and presenting research data, drawing conclusions and making recommendations for future management practice and research.", "到達目標": "By participating actively and collaboratively in this Group Research course, students should individually be able to:<BR/><BR/>- Demonstrate a practical understanding of the knowledge and competencies they need and can develop towards becoming recognised as a professional and ethical researcher in the fields of international business and management. <BR/><BR/>- Gain sufficient knowledge, skills and competencies to manage an independent research project effectively.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "Individual Research", "授業方法": "In-class and (if required) on-line.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Research as a process of managed critical enquiry", ""], "第2回": ["Identifying a research problem: attention to audience", "Prepare a critique of an example of &#39;seminal&#39; research"], "第3回": ["Formulating research objectives and questions", ""], "第4回": ["Justifying choices of research method: critical literature review", "Prepare a short, annotated (individual) Literature Review"], "第5回": ["Managing research data: sampling strategies", ""], "第6回": ["Introduction to data analysis #1: testing research hypotheses", "Draft a short questionnaire / survey instrument"], "第7回": ["Triangulation and controlling for bias: case study method", ""], "第8回": ["Introduction to data analysis #2: multivariable analysis<BR/>Mixed methods approaches: case study simulation", "Critiquing a published presentation of key findings (qualitative and quantitative)"], "第9回": ["Proposal writing workshop", ""], "第10回": ["Proposal writing workshop", "Draft a research proposal"], "第11回": ["Instructor gives group feedback on draft research proposals<BR/><BR/>Exploring the social roles of researchers: professional, competent and ethical project manager", ""], "第12回": ["Assessing research(er) performance: validity, reliability and credibility (ethics)", "Prepare a short individual research presentation that is based on the submitted and commented on draft research proposal"], "第13回": ["Individual research presentations (assessed)", ""], "第14回": ["Research Presentations (assessed)<BR/>Instructor gives feedback on research presentations", "Students prepare and submit a final research proposal (assessed)"]}, "評価": {"教科書Required texts0": "There is no required text for this course.
