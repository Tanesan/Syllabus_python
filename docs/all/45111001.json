However, assignments/homework/ assessments will be conducted, and lesson information/resources provided, on Google Classroom. As such, students will need access to a computer at home. <br /><br />Short lectures will be given by the instructor each week. Students are expected to take notes, as these lectures will introduce the themes of the course. Supplementary readings will be assigned for homework to introduce additional information and deepen students’ understanding. Students will also do further research on these topics.<br /><br />Students will have to regularly demonstrate detailed and critical understanding of the content of these lectures and readings, as they will form the basis of Written Responses (a kind of weekly test), group discussions, activities and presentations in the following classes. Lastly, students will have to create a research proposal, and then conduct and present an original research project on slang usage in their own context. The purpose is to develop the skills required to undertake a systematic inquiry into slang usage.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["All 14 sessions are conducted face to face<br />Course Introduction, What Is Slang?<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response"], "第2回": ["Slang Creation<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response"], "第3回": ["Slang Evolution<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response"], "第4回": ["British Slang<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response"], "第5回": ["Australian Slang<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response"], "第6回": ["English Slang in Expanding Circle Countries<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response"], "第7回": ["&nbsp;Slang Research Methodologies<div>- Mid-Term Assignment: Research Proposal</div>", "Prepare and submit Research Proposal,<br />Reading"], "第8回": ["Digital Slang: Dating &amp; Relationships<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response,<br />work on original research project"], "第9回": ["Digital Slang: Internet &amp; Gaming Slang<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response,<br />work on original research project"], "第10回": ["Digital Slang: Memes<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response,<br />work on original research project"], "第11回": ["Swearing 1*<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response,<br />work on original research project"], "第12回": ["Swearing 2*<br />-\tIn class written response, reading discussion, and mini lecture", "Reading, prepare for Written Response,<br />work on original research project"], "第13回": ["Final A (Original Research Project) preparation<div>Final B (Knowledge Check Test) preparation</div>", "Prepare for Final A+B"], "第14回": ["Final A+B<br />Reflection", ""], "授業計画1": "*Swearing 1,2: The content in these classes is for developing a functional understanding of English swear words, and is not intended for students' practical everyday conversational use.", "授業外学習2": "-\tMost weeks you will read and analyse articles using a Reading Review Sheet.
