Google Classroom will be used for some assignment information and submissions for all students so students need a Google account. Class time will NOT be spent watching movies or television shows, but rather, students will be expected to view assigned movies and television shows outside of class and be prepared to discuss them with their classmates during lessons. Finally, students will be asked to do an individual presentation at the end of the semester. This course is NOT a lecture style course, it requires students to have interactive discussions with classmates speaking only in English. The teacher will use Google Classroom for some course information and assignment submissions.<br />*INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS PERMITTED TO TAKE CLASSES ONLINE: If you cannot attend face-to-face classes for medical reasons (officially approved by the university before the semester begins) then you will need to join all lessons live using Zoom (Simultaneous two-way online broadcast of face-to-face classes).
