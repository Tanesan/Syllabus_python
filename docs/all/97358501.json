{"履修期": "春学期前半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "The objective of this course is for the student to understand the fundamental theory of finance. We will discuss how financial managers face two decisions- which real assets the firm should invest in and how to raise the cash to pay for them. Thus, the investment decision typically precedes the financial decision. This course will be devoted to different aspects of the investment decision. The first topic is how to value real and financial assets. The second topic is the link between the risk and value, and the third is the management of the capital investment process.\nAlong with the discussion on corporate asset, capital acquisitions and management, the course also deals with the issues related to agency problems and managerial incentives which might affect the value of a firm. This course will be facilitated by lectures, case discussions and exercises.", "到達目標": "Students will understand the theory of corporate finance to solve financial problems at companies.
