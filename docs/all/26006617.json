Each class will consist of reading about business topics; new vocabulary will be learned and practiced; there will be some comprehension questions and listening exercises. Once the students are confident with the vocabulary of the topic they will discuss together in groups of five or six students. They will then do research on the topic for home-work. This research will then be discussed by the students in groups and each week a selection of students will be chosen to deliver short presentations on the topic during which &quot;power-point&quot; may be used. In addition to a class textbook, videos related to business issues will be used as a resource in the class. In the last few weeks of the course each student will be expected to give a longer presentation on a business topic of their choice followed by questions and answers with the rest of the class. The students will be taught how to give presentations with confidence and impact.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Topic 1", "Research topic in preparation for the following week&#39;s discussions and presentations.
