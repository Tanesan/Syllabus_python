{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "In general, the image or perception of Japan is that it is a homogenous society.  What has led people to believe this? A popular theory, “Tanitsu Minzokuron,” a theory of one ethnicity, is commonly invoked to provide the rationale but it is an inadequate historical response; indeed, this theory emerged after WWII.  <BR/>This course will explore the “other side” of Japan through the historical lens of “minorities” such as Ainu(indigenous people), Burakumin(outcast people), Okinawan (the former Ryukyu kingdom), and Korean as well as Taiwanese/ Chinese (colonial descendants).<BR/>The goal of this course is to learn the basic historical background of these peoples and their current issues and struggles.  However, we will also discuss the concepts of the modern nation state, colonialism, ethnicity, culture, identity, assimilation and ideology.  As a larger theoretical framework, we will also discuss the relationship of the U.S. and Japan as it is critical to deepen the understanding of Japanese society and its treatment of “minorities.”", "到達目標": "The goal of this course is to learn  an introduction to the study of minority groups in Japan. <BR/>In general, the image or perception of Japan is that it is a homogenous society.
