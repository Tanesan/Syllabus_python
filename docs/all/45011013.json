You greatly enhance your acquisition of English by speaking it. In addition, speaking Japanese limits your classmates’ learning opportunities. Please encourage each other to speak English all the time you are in the classroom, especially for casual conversation! You lose participation points if you speak Japanese in class. Furthermore, students can expect to have an average of 30 minutes of preparation/homework before most classes.
