Google Classroom will be used for some assignment information and submissions, and also for regular contact with the teacher. Students need a Google account. This information will be explained in detail during the first lesson. This course is centered mainly on discussions. Students will discuss their opinions and ideas in pairs and in small groups. Students will be involved in presentations and discussions throughout the semester. <BR/>*If the pandemic worsens and classes need to be conducted online, all lessons will be done live using Zoom. The teacher will post updated information in LUNA and all students will be contacted individually by their KGU e-mail addresses to explain about online classes if on campus face-to-face classes are not possible in the Fall 2021 semester. Students who have completed the necessary documents and have been accepted by the university to take online classes instead of Face-to-Face classes must attend all classes live on Zoom. The teacher will contact students directly and give them the Zoom links through student KGU e-mail addresses. ONLY students who have permission from KGU to take online classes can use Zoom for the lessons, all other students need to attend classes regularly.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Course Introduction - General course information.

You greatly enhance your acquisition of English by speaking it. In addition, speaking Japanese limits your classmates’ learning opportunities. Please encourage each other to speak English all the time you are in the classroom, especially for casual conversation! You lose participation points if you speak Japanese in class. Furthermore, students can expect to have an average of 30 minutes of preparation/homework before most classes.
