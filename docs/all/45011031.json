Although the course is unified, in a typical week, one day may be basically a seminar and pair-work format; another day may often focus on presentation and discussion skills; and the third day may be devoted to research and writing. Active student interaction and participation is a strong expectation of this course. Currently, the intention is for this class to be taught face-to-face; adaptations may be made in light of changing conditions and university policies. Students are expected to follow safety protocols (i.e. wearing masks and respecting social distancing) during all face-to-face classes.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Course Information: Overview via Course Information Sheet<br />Overall schedule (current projection)<br />Speaking activities", "All 42 sessions to be conducted Face to Face.<br />Regular assignments will be given; an average of 45-90 minutes per assignment may be expected (with more preparation for major assignments needed).
