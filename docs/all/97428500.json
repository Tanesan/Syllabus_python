{"履修期": "秋学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course challenges students to think critically about Asian business and management. For the purpose of this course, Asia includes the following countries and provinces: China, Japan, India, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In the last few decades, the pendulum of economic power has shifted dramatically from the Western world to Asia, with its collective GDP far exceeding that of the European Union and the United States. Technological strengths have also shifted, particularly, to the leading four Asian countries (Japan, China, Korea, and India), resulting in formidable competition originating from firms in the region. \n\nIncreased opportunities have also emerged, however, for firms from the U.S. and Europe to take advantage of Asian technologies to complement their capabilities in exploring global market opportunities. In this course, a macro overview will be provided of Asian business characteristics and the similarities and dissimilarities among firms from major Asian countries will be examined. Second, the course will address macro-issues including economy, government industrial policy, and inter-firm relationships in these countries. Third, the course will include a review of the management, marketing, and product development practices in the region.", "到達目標": "Learning outcomes for this course, upon successful completion, include the ability to:\n1) analyze the competitiveness of Asian businesses, particularly those in Japan, China, Korea, and India, 2) examine the challenges and opportunities in competing and cooperating with them, and 3) trace key differences among business practices in the region.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "The course is taught using a combination of lectures, case analyses and class discussion.  The textbook will give you a broad picture of Asian business and management environment.  \n\nIn-Class Case Analyses (Individual):  To enhance your grasp and management of various problems global marketers face, four in-class case analyses are scheduled. A case analysis requires you to investigate a business problem, examine the alternative solutions, and propose the most effective solution using supporting evidence.  During the case discussion in class, I may designate one of you to summarize / analyze the case.  You are all expected to actively participate in the class discussion.  \n\nYou are also required to write a brief analysis of each case in no more than two pages (in Arial 12, 1.5 spacing) and send it to me by e-mail at least one day before the assigned case date.  \n\nTo preparing the written case analysis, follow the guidelines below:\n\n1.\tRead and Examine the Case Thoroughly:  Take notes, highlight relevant facts, underline key problems.\n2.\tFocus Your Analysis:  Identify a few key problems. Why do they exist? How do they affect the organization? Who is responsible for them?\n3.\tUncover Possible Solutions / Strategic Changes Needed:  Review course readings, discussions, outside research, your experience.\n4.\tSuggest the Best Solution:  Consider strong supporting evidence, pros, and cons. Is this solution realistic?\n\nTopics du jour (Individual and Class as a Whole):  Whenever time is available, we would like to discuss some current issues relevant to the topic of the day. You are encouraged to read newspapers, online news, and other sources to stay up-to-date with, and share with the class, some current topics, and issues relevant to the session for the class discussion.  It is considered part of your class participation.\n\nComprehensive Examination (Individual)\nOne comprehensive exam is scheduled during the final exam week.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["I.
