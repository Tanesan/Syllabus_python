{"履修期": "春学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "本授業では、受講生が経営科学技法を応用することにより経営上意思決定ができるようになることを目的とする。", "到達目標": "Learning goals for the students are to: <br />1. Acquire a deep understanding of what is a \"Business Decision\"<br />2. Learn and apply techniques for modelling business decisions.<br />3. Learn to identify critical information needed to make better decisions<br />4. Review and apply statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze the information available for making decisions.<br />5. Learn current techniques used for collecting, storing, and managing information needed to support decision making.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "The objective of this course is to enable the student to become an intelligent user of management science techniques, not experts in statistics or computer software.<br />The course explains:<br />1: the fundamental qualitative and quantitative concepts that underlie business decision making. Not just a way of calculating, but as a way of thinking, in order to enhance<br />decision-making skills.<br />2. how to make informed business decision using various Management Science techniques.<br />3. the mathematical/statistical aspects of the techniques. The focus is on usage of the methods and interpretation of their results.<br />4. by detailed examples and case studies, how basic tools for managing the data and for making sense of data, are used in making business decisions.<br />5. The IT infrastructure, architecture and other aspects of Information Management that is required for Decision Making.<br /><br />Introductory probability, decision analysis, basic statistics, regression, simulation, and linear optimization will be reviewed.<br />Spreadsheet exercises, cases, and examples drawn from marketing, finance, operations management, and other management functions are used to illustrate the topics.<br />MS Excel will be the primary tool to solve decision-making problems and to build small scale decision support systems.", "授業方法": "HyFlex Format: <br />The course contents will be interactively presented with ample opportunities for questions and discussions on each topic. Case studies will be used to illustrate various topics. Decision models will be built in class.<br />Prior to each class students will be expected to read the case studies and solve the weekly problem sets.<br />In class students will be expected to demonstrate their learning from case studies by participating in the class discussions.<br />Mid term and final exams will be based on case studies.<br />(Refer to the course information board on LUNA for all reading assignments, case studies and weekly problem sets. Solutions to weekly problem sets will also be posted after assignment due date. Late assignments will only be accepted under exceptional circumstances and students should make prior arrangements with the instructor.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction<br />[Review] Case-Study - Understanding the problem<br />[Lecture] Decision Analysis I <br />   Making decision in uncertain environments<br />   Modeling your decision Problem", "Before Coming to class read (Time: 1 hour): <br />  Chapter 1 Sections: 1.1 - 1.4;
