Acquire a deep understanding of what is a &quot;Business Decision&quot;<BR/>2. Learn and apply techniques for modelling business decisions.<BR/>3. Learn to identify critical information needed to make better decisions<BR/>4. Review and apply statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze the information available for making decisions.<BR/>5. Learn current techniques used for collecting, storing, and managing information needed to support decision making.", "授業方法": "Online Format: Simultaneous and Two-way. (HyFlex will only be used for workshops where it requires intensive interaction between students.)<BR/>The course contents will be interactively presented with ample opportunities for questions and discussions on each topic. Case studies will be used to illustrate various topics. Decision models will be built in class.<BR/>Prior to each class students will be expected to read the case studies and solve the weekly problem sets.<BR/>In class students will be expected to demonstrate their learning from case studies by participating in the class discussions.<BR/>Mid term and final exams will be based on case studies.<BR/>(Refer to the course information board on LUNA for all reading assignments, case studies and weekly problem sets. Solutions to weekly problem sets will also be posted after assignment due date. Late assignments will only be accepted under exceptional circumstances and students should make prior arrangements with the instructor.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction<BR/>[Review] Case-Study - Understanding the problem<BR/>[Lecture] Decision Analysis I <BR/>   Making decision in uncertain environments<BR/>   Modeling your decision Problem", "Before Coming to class read (Time: 1 hour): <BR/>  Chapter 1 Sections: 1.1 - 1.4;
