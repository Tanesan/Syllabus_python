{"履修期": "春学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "Financial statement analysis is one important step in business analysis. Financial statements are the most visible products of a company’s financial reporting process. Business analysis is the process of evaluating a company’s economic prospects and risks. This includes analyzing a company’s business environment, its strategies, and its financial position and performance. Business analysis is useful in a wide range of business decisions such as investing in equity or debt securities, extending credit through short or long term loans, valuing a business in an initial public offering (IPO), and evaluating restructurings including mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. Financial statement analysis is the application of analytical tools and techniques to general-purpose financial statements and related data to derive estimates and inferences useful in business analysis.", "到達目標": "The goal for this course is to equip you with a framework for using financial reports in a variety of business analyses, so that you can practically interpret financial reporting and analyze data provided in financial statements.", "授業方法": "Students need to pre-apply for the course during 4/1～4/3 on Kyogaku web <BR/>Face-to-face in-class lectures and discussions.
