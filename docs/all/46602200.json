{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "The objective of this course is to understand how culture affects the way we communicate. The focus will be on raising awareness of the relationship between culture and our values, attitudes and behavior. The course will investigate the different factors that influence people&#39;s communication. Students will be expected to first reflect on their own culture and communication styles and then make comparisons with those of other cultures. Understanding comes not only through cognitive and academic study, but also by being aware of our own emotional reactions. Thus, there will be a strong focus on experiential learning and reflective practice. This course will also put a minor focus on oral communication and the basic skills needed to successfully deliver a message to an audience.", "到達目標": "Students will become more aware of their own culture and communication styles. They will gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of the essential nature of cultural differences. They will learn about unconscious and hidden factors of intercultural communication. They will be able to articulate their findings in a clear and objective way. They will learn that emotional responses are equally important and need not be avoided.", "授業方法": "Online format:Simultaneous and two-way. This is a COIL course.
