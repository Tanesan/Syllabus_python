At your host institution, you are expected to comply with your host institution’s regulations and be punctual for opening time, various meetings and deadlines. Be sure that you do not think of yourself as an “invited guest” at your host institution and expect to take care of your own affairs by yourself.\n\nPre-Internship Presentation (15%):\nMake a 10-minute short group presentation on your host institution and its industry. Briefly introduce your host institution and its business type, and identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats at your host institution. Evaluations will be made by instructors based on the following points: content and structure of your presentation, understanding of your host institution and response to questions.\n\nCritical Reflection Paper (25%):\nAs you perform your internship, write a 300-word critical reflection paper on what you have experienced each day. Just describing your duties and accomplishments are not sufficient. You do need to describe your thoughts on your experience and support your points with reasons and evidence (e.g. If you think some business practices at your host company are “strange,” you need to clarify why those practices are strange for you, and why you think the host institution implement such “strange” practices). Please compile and hand in the reflection paper on the final day of the class (Sep.2nd). Not all placements are similar so the marking will take this into account.\n\n\nFinal Presentation (20%):\nMake a 10-minute group presentation on the final day of the course (Sep. 2nd). Briefly introduce your internship tasks and describe the lessons you learned from the internship. (e.g. lessons you gained from working with your partner and employees at your host organization.) You do not need to re-introduce your host company and its industry. Evaluations will be made based on the following points:\n\n1) Content and structure of your presentation\n2) Critical reflections on your internship experience supported by reasons and evidence (anecdotes and personal episodes.)\n3) Response to questions\n\nFinal Group Report: (20%)\nImagine that you are a business advisor to the new CEO of Company X. The company plans to enter the Japanese market within a year. Based on class discussions at KGU and your internship experience at your host organization, write a report (2000 words double-spaced) for the CEO that explains a few characteristics of Japanese companies (or Multinational companies in Japan) and effective ways to do business in the Japanese market.\n\nSubmitting papers\nCritical reflection paper and final group report should be both in person and submitted as a digital file via Google drive (Deadline: 11:59 am on Sep 2nd).\nThe suggested name of the file: “GI by (your name) _ (your host company).”\n\n*Late submission of assignments will be penalized.\n\nPlagiarism is the use of the written work of others (either direct copies or close paraphrases) as one’s own original work. If quotations and/or passages from other works are used in your papers, they must be accorded the proper citation in order to avoid any misunderstandings about plagiarism.", "備考Note0": "Syllabus file attached", "更新日時/Date of Update1": "2023年07月07日 13時29分54秒", "項番No.0": [], "項番No.1": ["2023年度", "春学期集中／Intensive (Spring)", "集中・その他／Concentration/Other", "春学期集中／Intensive (Spring)", "未定"]}, "campas": 0, "name": "【300】CCC Global Internship in Japan／CCC Global Internship in Japan", "管理部署": 24, "単位数": 3, "担当者": "劉　ジェームズ（Liu James） ", "履修基準年度": "２年", "緊急授業形態": 0, "オンライン授業形態": 4, "時限1": 49, "評価1": 3, "評価2": 4, "開講期": 8}
