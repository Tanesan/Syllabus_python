{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course aims to produce confident speakers of English who feel comfortable in a one-to-one interaction with a native speaker and are able to express their ideas, initiate and understand conversation at an intermediate level. To achieve these goals, a content-based approach to language learning will be adopted, whereby students will be trained to interact with spoken and written texts on issues of global concern. [This class uses the same textbook as 英語ＢI and II but covers the latter half of the book.]", "到達目標": "Activities will include group discussions, simulations, case studies and debates, and students will be guided in the preparation of oral presentations. Project work will give practice in topic selection and research, note taking and the planning and writing of mini reports.", "授業方法": "IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a face-to-face course, but it may move online depending on events related to the pandemic.
