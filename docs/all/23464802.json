Active participation is extremely important and counts as a significant part of students’ evaluation marks. 2. Attendance is crucial to students’ success in this course. The instructor will carefully mark students’ attendance as present and on time, late, or absent. Specific rules regarding attendance are as follows: 2a) Only students who are present at the time the class begins will receive full attendance marks. 2b) Any student walking into the classroom after the class has begun will be marked late. The instructor will take this into account when giving students a participation grade. 2c) Being 15 to 29 minutes late will equal half an absence (0.5). 2d) Each time students are late 30 minutes or more, they will be marked absent. However, they are still encouraged to attend. 2e) As a general rule, no more than three absences will be permitted in this course.", "備考Note0": "In principle, the use of smartphones in class is strictly forbidden.
