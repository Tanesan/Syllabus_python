Through this course we will, therefore, look together at various aspects of culture such as its political quality, its flexibility and spontaneity, and enduring and volatile natures, in order to pave the way for more critical examination and discussion about culture.", "到達目標": "Upon successfully completing the course, you should be able to:<BR/>- Demonstrate a concrete understanding of various aspects of culture;<BR/>- Understand its diversity as well as contingency, without uncritically accepting the idea;<BR/>- Demonstrate an ability to make a positive contribution to the class even in this difficult situation;<BR/>- With a degree of confidence, begin to critically engage with source materials in order to accurately grasp and summarize key themes/topics in comments, assignments, presentation and/or the final essay.", "特記事項": "この科目は、10/10（月・祝）までの授業をオンデマンドで実施します。履修者確定後、履修者数が教室定員内であれば対面授業となり、教室定員を超えているとオンライン授業となります。なお、対面授業の場合は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”とはなりませんが、オンライン授業の場合は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”となりますので、60単位を超えて卒業に必要な単位として算入することができません（60単位までしか算入できない）。なお、履修者確定後、10/11（火）以降の授業形態を履修者へお知らせします。<BR/>The course will be offered on-demand until Monday, October 10 (holiday).
