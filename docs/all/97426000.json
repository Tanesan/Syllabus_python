{"履修期": "秋学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "The course challenges you to think critically about the role of marketing in the increasingly global economy. As such, rote learning of terms and concepts is not sufficient; you are prepared to take the senior marketing executive’s seat in managing business on a global basis. The senior marketing executive has the responsibility for designing, implementing, and guiding an organization's marketing efforts. Marketing executives are by definition generalists. They do not have to be expert practitioners in every aspect of marketing. However, they do need to have a solid understanding of each aspect.\n\nThe course emphasizes decision-making processes related to the organization and its markets in accordance with marketing management principles. The course has many practical elements but also provides the conceptual tools necessary for managers to abstract, analyze, understand and predict existing and future markets and customers. Contemporary and persuasive issues such as the increased globalization of markets (and the current opposite political force of anti-globalization sentiment), the importance of changing technologies as well as legal issues, and the impact of cultural considerations on marketing and branding decision making are recognized and integrated into the course.", "到達目標": "The fundamental premise underlying market-driven strategy is that the market and customers that form the market are the starting point in strategy formulation. Described as market-driven strategy, the key challenges for business organizations include:  1) developing a shared vision throughout the organization about the market and how it is likely to change in the future; 2) identifying opportunities for delivering superior value to customers; 3) positioning the organization and its brands in the market place to obtain the best match between distinctive capabilities and value opportunities; 4) recognizing the potential benefits of partnering with customers, suppliers, distribution channel members, internal functions, and even competitors; and 5) implementing and managing marketing strategy on a global basis.  At the end of the course, you will learn the changing nature of global competition and the importance of the simultaneous pursuit of economies of scale and cultural sensitivities in marketing operations.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "The course is taught, using a combination of lectures, case analysis and class discussion.
