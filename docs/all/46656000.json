{"履修期": "春学期集中", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course will provide you with an in-depth understanding of the forces shaping<BR/>contemporary Japan. In order to understand Japan as it is today, we will explore the<BR/>socio political forces that have shaped Japanese society. Along the way, we will explore<BR/>how choices made in the adoption of social policy have created a very distinct political<BR/>system. Furthermore, we will discuss how both traditional and current expressions of<BR/>culture weigh heavy in the politics of Japan.<BR/>We will start the course by becoming familiar with the most important actors and<BR/>institutions shaping Japanese politics. We will then study how these actors and<BR/>institutions interact with ideology, identity, and economic forces to shape how political<BR/>events unfold. From there, we will focus our attention on the big problems facing the<BR/>country, these include: the struggling economy, an aging population, welfare,<BR/>healthcare, and gender and sexuality issues. Specifically, we will pay close attention to<BR/>the role of public policy reforms in immigration, education, environment, and social<BR/>services. Then, we will explore how such issues manifest themselves in contemporary<BR/>culture.", "到達目標": "・Understand the main forces shaping contemporary Japanese Society.<BR/>・Understand how Japanese policymakers think about addressing the countries main challenges.
