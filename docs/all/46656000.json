{"履修期": "春学期集中", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course will provide you with an in-depth understanding of the forces shaping<br />contemporary Japan. In order to understand Japan as it is today, we will explore the<br />socio political forces that have shaped Japanese society. Along the way, we will explore<br />how choices made in the adoption of social policy have created a very distinct political<br />system. Furthermore, we will discuss how both traditional and current expressions of<br />culture weigh heavy in the politics of Japan.<br />We will start the course by becoming familiar with the most important actors and<br />institutions shaping Japanese politics. We will then study how these actors and<br />institutions interact with ideology, identity, and economic forces to shape how political<br />events unfold. From there, we will focus our attention on the big problems facing the<br />country, these include: the struggling economy, an aging population, welfare,<br />healthcare, and gender and sexuality issues. Specifically, we will pay close attention to<br />the role of public policy reforms in immigration, education, environment, and social<br />services. Then, we will explore how such issues manifest themselves in contemporary<br />culture.", "到達目標": "・Understand the main forces shaping contemporary Japanese Society.<br />・Understand how Japanese policymakers think about addressing the countries main challenges.
