In general, the macroeconomy affects business and society, and the aggregate economic trend is often broadly predictable. The course first introduces the core concepts, basic terminology, and the measurements of the macroeconomic variables. Then, it examines the factors behind the long-term economic growth in living standards and short-term economic fluctuations. The course explains how central banks and governments can better manage such fluctuations to raise the growth trend. While examining the theories of macroeconomics, it explores their applications to real-world situations in both developed and developing countries.", "授業方法": "Students will receive the required readings one week before and the lecture notes after each session.
