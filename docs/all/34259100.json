For those who applied to take courses on-line, I will conduct real-time zoom sessions during course hours. Course pedagogy includes lectures on topics followed by case studies to illustrate and reinforce concepts. Students are expected to have read and prepped, within groups, the assigned problem prior to attending the face-to-face class. The textbook will be used to pick up the conceptual tools to prep for each case. The instructor will supply all the reading materials in advance. Please note that we are still experiencing the COVID-19 crisis, impeding me from offering a face-to-face class. In that context, I would offer this class online using zoom during this crisis period. I would send you the lecture power points and reading materials soon. Please send me your email address to adhikarykobejp@gmail.com to get the necessary instructions on course-related information and reading materials. Also, I am leaving here my cell phone number 08039854615 so that you can contact me on Viber and reach me at any time for class consultation.
