It serves as an intensive alternative to the standard English requirement, which generally takes two years and meets just once a week in large classes. <br />The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms.  Toward this end, there is a focus on communication and interaction in class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively. <br />Active all-English participation is required for success in this course, and at the end of IE-II, students of all sections are expected to have developed a degree of conversational confidence and competence well-beyond that of their average colleague.", "授業方法": "The class will be 100% face-to-face.
