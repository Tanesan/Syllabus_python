BYOD to class is recommended- laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Short lectures will be given by the instructor each week. Students are expected to take notes, as these lectures will introduce the themes of the course. Supplementary readings will be assigned for homework to introduce additional information and deepen students’ understanding. Students will also do further research on these topics.<br /><br />Students will have to regularly demonstrate detailed and critical understanding of the content of these lectures and readings, as they will form the basis of written assignments, and active discussions or presentations in spoken English in the following class.
