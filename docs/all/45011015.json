It serves as an intensive alternative to the standard English requirement, which generally takes two years and meets just once a week in large classes. <BR/>The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms.  Toward this end, there is a focus on communication and interaction in class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively. <BR/>Active all-English participation is required for success in this course, and at the end of IE-II, students of all sections are expected to have developed a degree of conversational confidence and competence well-beyond that of their average colleague.", "授業方法": "For AY 2022/2023 the plan is to teach face-to-face in the classroom with precautions to prevent the spread of covid. However, if the covid situation worsens there is a possibility that classes may be moved to partially or wholly online. The teacher will update you at that time in detail if that happens but in general, classes would use Zoom, Luna, and other online tools.<BR/><BR/>Students will learn in a variety of modes. These modes will include individual work but collaborative learning in pairs and small groups will be the most common mode of study. Teacher-centered activities will be kept short and few in number.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Week 1<BR/>Introduction to course objectives, schedule, and materials.<BR/>Set up all digital accounts and class rules and procedures.<BR/>All 14 sessions are conducted Face to face<BR/>Self-introductions and icebreakers.<BR/>Explanation of writing notebook first short written homework.<BR/>Explanation of CEFR system and start to practice CEFR A2 speaking tasks.<BR/>Kehe and Kehe Topic 1 and 2", "2 Hours"], "第2回": ["Week 2<BR/>Explanation of English Central and first monthly assignment.<BR/>Kehe and Kehe Topics 3 and 4 <BR/>Explanation of projects later in the semester.<BR/>Explanation of movie study and movie vocabulary.<BR/>Watch the first scene of the movie.<BR/>Explanation of Quizlet app and quiz system.", "2 Hours"], "第3回": ["Week 3<BR/>A1 CEFR Topics. <BR/>Kehe and Kehe topics 5 and 6<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scenes plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第4回": ["Week 4<BR/>A1 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Kehe and Kehe topics 7 and 8<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scenes plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第5回": ["Week 5<BR/>A1 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Kehe and Kehe topics 9 and 10<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scenes plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第6回": ["Week 6<BR/>Speaking Test One.
