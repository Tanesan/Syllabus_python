A Google Classroom site will be used for most course information and assignment submissions, and also for any outside of class contact with the teacher. Email the teacher at mjchang@kwansei.ac.jp to get the Google Classroom site code to register. This course is centered mainly on discussions based on the textbook and test-taking skill topics. This is an interactive style course, it requires interactive English only discussions with classmates every lesson.<BR/>&lt;Information for students permitted to take classes online&gt;<BR/>Sessions will be held simultaneously via Zoom (meeting code will be posted on the Google Classroom site). Session 1 will be face-to-face. Lesson details will be updated on the Google Classroom site by 5:30 pm the day before our class time (Mondays). Email the teacher at mjchang@kwansei.ac.jp to get the Google Classroom site code to register.<BR/>*If the pandemic situation changes in September - October and we need to have the sessions online, students can check the Google Classroom site for teacher updated information and students may also be contacted individually by their KGU e-mail addresses to explain about online classes if on campus face-to-face classes are not possible for the Fall 2021 semester. <BR/>**If classes are to be held online, all classes will be live using Zoom for synchronous style classes via Zoom.<BR/><BR/>Classes will include discussions, presentations, pair work and group work.
