The teacher will post updated information in LUNA and all students will be contacted individually by their KGU e-mail addresses to explain about online classes if on campus face-to-face classes are not possible in the Fall 2022 semester. <BR/>Students who have completed the necessary documents and have been accepted by the university to take online classes instead of Face-to-Face classes must attend all classes live on Zoom. The teacher will contact students directly and give them the Zoom links through student KGU e-mail addresses. ONLY students who have permission from KGU to take online classes can use Zoom for the lessons, all other students need to attend classes regularly. <BR/>-----<BR/>This course will include presentations, pair work, and group work.
