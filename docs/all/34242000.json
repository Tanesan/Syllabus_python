The second part will examine political regime of the postwar Japan.　The emphasis is on the roles that the politicians played for better or worse.  One of the objectives of this course is to think critically about competing theories of development （economists, sociologists, political scientists）.  In each part, one of the purposes of the course is to demystify mysterious element of “Japaneseness”in the political economy of Japan. Students are welcome to participate and bring various perspectives and experiences to the class.", "特記事項": "本授業科目は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”ではありません。<BR/>The course is not subject to the 60-credit limit for online courses.<BR/><BR/>【合併】総合日本学習科目（政治経済）（CIEC）/Political Economy of Japan（国際学部）", "関連科目": "", "授業方法": "In case you participate via Zoom<BR/><BR/>Political Economy of Japan<BR/><BR/>https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84811283221?pwd=blE2MDcraFk3ZDA1N3o3MlJZWWxXUT09<BR/><BR/>meeting ID: 848 1128 3221<BR/>pass code: 874707", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction", ""], "第2回": ["PART I: POLITICAL ECONOMY: Developmental State?<BR/>Culture, Ideology", ""], "第3回": ["Dominant Explanations for the Political of Japan", ""], "第4回": ["State or Market?", ""], "第5回": ["Japanese Firms", ""], "第6回": ["Japanese Workers", ""], "第7回": ["Varieties of Capitalism", ""], "第8回": ["PART II:PUBLIC POLICIES: Welfare State?<BR/>Public Policies in General", ""], "第9回": ["Developmental State or Welfare State?", ""], "第10回": ["Local Governments", ""], "第11回": ["Minority", ""], "第12回": ["Women", ""], "第13回": ["Japan&#39;s New Politics", ""], "第14回": ["Japan&#39;s New Political Economy", ""], "授業外学習2": "Readings are kept to a minimum so that students can reasonably be expected to complete them in time to participate actively in class."}, "評価": {"教科書Required texts0": "Kozo Yamamura and Yasukichi Yasuba, eds., The Political Economy of Japan, volume １, The Domestic Transformation （Stanford University Press, 1987）.
