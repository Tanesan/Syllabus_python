The class functions as a community in which the members support each other to express themselves and students must primarily communicate with the teacher and all students in English only. The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms. There is a focus on oral fluency development and interactive communication in every class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively.", "授業方法": "2023 April UPDATE: If online learning becomes mandatory at some time during this semester than classes will be simultaneous live Zoom lessons. Class materials and teacher contact/communication outside of class time will be done through Google Classroom.<br />This course is centred mainly on discussions. Students will discuss their opinions and ideas in pairs and in small groups. Students will be involved in presentation discussions throughout the semester. Presentation discussions will be conducted in small groups. One individual in-class presentation will also be given by each student to the entire class. There will also be a focus on developing writing skills this semester.<br />*(INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS PERMITTED TO TAKE CLASSES ONLINE).
