The Zoom link will be provided on Luna as well as through email sent to the student&#39;s KGU registered email address. The instructor will send out information about the first meeting and when to meet *before* it is held on Sept. 21. Therefore, please be sure to check your university email (e.g., ___@kwansei.ac.jp) a few days before the start of the semester.  Currently, it seems that the state of emergency will be lifted sometime in November. If that happens, we will return to face-to-face lessons. Students may use the regularly assigned classrooms on campus if they wish to conduct Zoom lessons.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Orientation, explanation of rules of the course", "Read the syllabus"], "第2回": ["Ice-breaking activity, basics of sentence, pre-paragraph instruction", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第3回": ["Textbook Lesson 1", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第4回": ["Textbook Lesson 1", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第5回": ["Textbook Lesson 1", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第6回": ["Textbook Lesson 2", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第7回": ["Textbook Lesson 2", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment, work on paragraph"], "第8回": ["Textbook Lesson 2", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第9回": ["Textbook Lesson 3, Paragraph Assignment 1 due", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第10回": ["Textbook Lesson 3", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第11回": ["Textbook Lesson 3", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第12回": ["Textbook Lesson 4", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第13回": ["Textbook Lesson 4", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment, work on paragraph"], "第14回": ["Textbook Lesson 4", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第15回": ["Textbook Lesson 5, Paragraph Assignment 2 due", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第16回": ["Textbook Lesson 5", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第17回": ["Textbook Lesson 5", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第18回": ["Textbook Lesson 6", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第19回": ["Textbook Lesson 6", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment, work on paragraph"], "第20回": ["Textbook Lesson 6", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第21回": ["Textbook Lesson 7, Presentation 1", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment, work on paragraph"], "第22回": ["Textbook Lesson 7, Presentation 1", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第23回": ["Textbook Lesson 7", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment, work on paragraph"], "第24回": ["Textbook Lesson 8,  Paragraph Assignment 3", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment"], "第25回": ["Textbook Lesson 8", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第26回": ["Textbook Lesson 8", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第27回": ["Textbook Lesson 9", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第28回": ["Textbook Lesson 9", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第29回": ["Textbook Lesson 9", "Chat groups sheet, Breaking News English Assignment"], "第30回": ["Textbook Lesson 10", "TOEFL word list and question sheet, study words, textbook assignment , work on paragraph"], "第31回": ["Textbook Lesson 10, Presentation 2, Paragraph Assignment 4", "Prepare final presentation"], "第32回": ["Textbook Lesson 10, Presentation 2, Paragraph Assignment 4", "Prepare final presentation and reflect"], "授業外学習2": "All students are required to have homework completed before the beginning of class.
