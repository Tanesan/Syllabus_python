First, we will focus on the evolution and development of IOs in the historical context. Second, we will learn why and how states create and use IOs and how IOs may influence state behaviors. We will do so by surveying and examining various theoretical arguments on the roles of IOs in global governance. Third, we will explore and discuss the role of IOs in particular issue areas. The course is conducted in lecture format supplemented with class discussion. <br /><br />LUNA:<br />We will be using LUNA for this course. I will post all course materials, announcements, and grades on this system. You will also post your final essay on LUNA. Please note that it is your responsibility to check for course updates on LUNA on a regular basis. <br /><br />All materials related to the course (including lecture slides) are copyrighted. You are prohibited to upload, distribute, or publish through any SNS and websites.<br /><br />INSTRUCTOR CONTACT:<br />Please feel free to contact me via email (hlt39472@kwansei.ac.jp) any time you think discussion on an individual basis would be helpful. It is important to me that this course enriches your educational experience.  <br /><br />ANTHER REQUIREMENTS:<br />Classroom Etiquette: Please recognize that our classroom includes people with various life experiences, divergent perspectives, and different levels of English proficiency.<br /><br />Academic Honesty: Students are expected to adhere to Honor Code policies on all assignments and exams. Also, students are strongly urged to familiarize themselves with the definition of plagiarism and avoid it. <br /><br />Grade Appeals: If you think a grade I assigned you is incorrect, you can request me to consider re-grading. All grade appeals, however, must be made in writing. You should write a brief memo explaining your concerns and submit this memo to me along with the graded assignment. I will review your concerns and I may re-grade if necessary. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />I reserve the right to modify the syllabus and assignments throughout the semester. Modifications will be well communicated through LUNA and in class.", "授業方法": "COURSE FORMAT:<br />Classes will be conducted in a \"face-to-face\" only.<br />", "トピック": {"第1回": ["※All 14 classes are \"face-to-face.\" （全て「対面授業」で行います）<br />Introduction to Course", "No Readings"], "第2回": ["Governing Political Space 1: What is Sovereign State System?", "Spruyt, Hendrik. 1994.
