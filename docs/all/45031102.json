Debate, rather than conversation, will be the focus of the class. Students will be gradually introduced to the language and skills needed for debate, and will take part in practice debates. Students will engage in active learning: working individually, in pairs, groups and as a whole class to debate global issues, developing cross-cultural awareness, and improve academic and language skills. The class will be conducted face-to-face. Assignments/homework/assessments will be conducted, and lesson information/resources provided, on Google Classroom. As such, students will need access to a computer at home. BYOD to class is recommended. Students will also need a notebook for notetaking and for creating their own debate 'textbook'", "トピック": {"第1回": ["All 28 sessions are conducted face to face<br />Week 1<br />-\tIntroduction: Course, Debate Procedures, and Terminology<br />-\tCreating Signposts, Reasons, and Supports", "At least 60 minutes"], "第2回": ["Week 2<br />-\tDebate 1: Topic Introduction, Quiz<br />-\tTopic Introduction 2", "At least 60 minutes"], "第3回": ["Week 3<br />-\tSkill Focus: Constructive Speeches, Question & Answer<br />-\tPractice Debate 1: Preparation", "At least 60 minutes"], "第4回": ["Week 4<br />-\t＊＊Practice Debate 1＊＊<br />-\tDebate 2: Topic Introduction, Quiz", "At least 60 minutes"], "第5回": ["Week 5<br />-\tTopic Introduction 2<br />-\tSkill Focus: Refutations and Replies", "At least 60 minutes"], "第6回": ["Week 6<br />-\tPractice Debate 2: Preparation<br />-\t＊＊Practice Debate 2＊＊", "At least 60 minutes"], "第7回": ["Week 7<br />-\tIn-Class Mid Term<br />-\tDebate 3: Topic Introduction, Quiz", "At least 60 minutes"], "第8回": ["Week 8<br />-\tTopic Introduction 2 + Note Taking Revisited<br />-\tSkill Focus: Advanced Supports", "At least 60 minutes"], "第9回": ["Week 9<br />-\tPractice Debate 3: Preparation <br />-\t＊＊Practice Debate 3＊＊", "At least 60 minutes"], "第10回": ["Week 10<br />-\tDebate 4: Topic Introduction, Quiz<br />-\tTopic Introduction 2 + Advanced Note Taking", "At least 60 minutes"], "第11回": ["Week 11<br />-\tSkill Focus: Advanced refutations<br />-\tPractice Debate 4 Preparation", "At least 60 minutes"], "第12回": ["Week 12<br />-\t＊＊Practice Debate 4＊＊<br />-\tDebate Final: Topic Introduction", "At least 60 minutes"], "第13回": ["Week 13<br />-\tSkill Focus: Cross-Examination Questions and Constructive Speeches<br />-\tIn-Class Final Exam", "At least 60 minutes"], "第14回": ["Week 14<br />-\tDebate Final: Preparation<br />-\t＊＊Debate Final＊＊", "At least 60 minutes"], "授業外学習2": "-\tFor all class periods you will be required to complete homework assignments.
