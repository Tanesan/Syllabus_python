Google Classroom will be used for some course information and assignment submissions, and, also for any outside of class contact with the teacher. This course is centered mainly on discussions based on project and topic information. This is NOT a lecture style course, it requires interactive English only discussions with classmates every lesson.<BR/>*If the pandemic worsens and classes need to be conducted online, all lessons will be done live using Zoom. The teacher will post updated information in LUNA and all students will be contacted individually by their KGU e-mail addresses to explain about online classes if on campus face-to-face classes are not possible in the Spring 2022 semester. Students who have completed the necessary documents and have been accepted by the university to take online classes instead of Face-to-Face classes must attend all classes live on Zoom. The teacher will contact students directly and give them the Zoom links through student KGU e-mail addresses. ONLY students who have permission from KGU to take online classes can use Zoom for the lessons, all other students need to attend classes regularly. <BR/>-----<BR/>This course will include presentations, pair work, and group work. Assignments may require the use of a computer and online sites.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Class Policies &amp; Plan<BR/>Review Activities from Spring Break<BR/>Format: On campus, face-to-face", "1-2 hours"], "第2回": ["Quiz &amp;
