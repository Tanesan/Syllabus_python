{"履修期": "春学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "One immediate purpose of this course is to build on what the students have learned individually from their experience of the Group Research course. Students also have the opportunity to choose and develop a research topic and / or series of research questions that interest them most, drawing on the full scope of IMC courses and on their individual experiences of work and study. Students should choose a research topic along with research questions and research objectives that demonstrate a clear relevance to current and emerging trends in international business and management practice. The research design should be conducted and delivered at a standard appropriate for Masters-level study. Ideally, individual students can use this course as an opportunity to become ‘expert’ in a particular aspect of business and management and thus improve their options for future career and professional development.", "到達目標": "The instructor as supervisor expects students to work responsibly, ethically and with clear objectives in mind. The instructor as supervisor will also encourage students to determine what type of ‘audience’ they intend to inform and enlighten with their research: e.g. what can managers in organisations, business investors or entrepreneurs learn from the student’s research process and findings? What contribution to current management and business knowledge and practice can the student make with the processes and products of their individual research?<BR/><BR/>On this basis, an overarching learning goal for this course is:<BR/>•By engaging actively and collaboratively with this course, individual students should become confident in their roles and responsibilities as independently resourceful researchers.", "授業方法": "Drawing on the instructor&#39;s experiences of teaching an earlier IMC course of this type, this  version of the Individual Research course has been designed to be delivered in either face-to-face or hybrid / hyflex modes.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["The research proposal: process", ""], "第2回": ["The research proposal: product", "Prepare an individual re-assessment of proposals written or discussed during the Group Research course."], "第3回": ["Research design: justification", ""], "第4回": ["The critical literature review", "Each IR student designates target &#39;audiences&#39; for the research problem they are researching"], "第5回": ["The researcher role: skills and competencies", ""], "第6回": ["The researcher role: performance (audience)", "Students prepare to give a brief presentation in class about progress towards submitting a draft Thesis (non-assessed)"], "第7回": ["Seminar: presenting a research proposal to a critical audience", ""], "第8回": ["Instructor gives group feedback on the individual presentations", "Students prepare a first draft of their Thesis"], "第9回": ["The discussant role at conference presentations: &quot;What&#39;s your thesis?&quot;", ""], "第10回": ["Role play: student simulate their roles as discussants and give constructive feedback to the research proposals and earlier presentations of their peers", "Students submit a first draft of their Thesis (assessed)"], "第11回": ["Instructor gives individual feedback on the draft Thesis submissions", ""], "第12回": ["Students explain how and why they have revised their Thesis in response to processes of critical review", "Students prepare a final draft of their Thesis"], "第13回": ["Instructor responds to individual questions about the process and product of the final submission: e.g. against the IMC guidelines for Individual Research Theses.", ""], "第14回": ["Instructor responds to individual student queries about the final submission process.", "Students submit a final draft of their Thesis"]}, "評価": {"教科書Required texts0": "There are no required texts for this course.
