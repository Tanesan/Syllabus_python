{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "Through the profound comprehension of the “Industrial Policy” implemented by the　European Committee and the member countries of BU, we will reach more profound comprehension on this controversial policy. The important argument is based on political preference between social and/or liberal model of capitalism such as policies seeking social equity or justice and/or toward the free market system or full competition economic system. <BR/>We will read carefully the books published recently on the new industrial policies arguments just for highlighting the new arguments on the importance of what is called “Industrial Policy”. The economists ask themselves if this controversial policy would be swelled up in the long period stagnation of the EU economy. We learn also the System of National Account (SNA), especially the Input-Output Table Analysis, to understand the statistical base of Industrial Policy.", "到達目標": "The students are invited to attain a plain sense of supply-side economic policy and of governmental intervention called “industrial policy”.
