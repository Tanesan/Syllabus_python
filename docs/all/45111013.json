The student observes culture from the perspective of the subject of the study. Students will learn qualitative research methods that are used in ethnography but also in the other social sciences such as anthropology, sociology, and psychology. Language is difficult to separate from the culture it comes from so studying culture can help understand target languages. Although this topic sounds very academic it is also very social and cultural and so most students find the study enjoyable. The research methods introduced will be useful in many disciplines regardless of language.", "授業方法": "For AY 2022/2023 the plan is to teach face-to-face in the classroom with precautions to prevent the spread of covid. However, if the covid situation worsens there is a possibility that classes may be moved to partially or wholly online. The teacher will update you at that time in detail if that happens but in general classes would use Zoom, Luna, and other online tools.<BR/><BR/>There will be some short lecture style sessions but these will always be followed up with pair and small group work for discussion.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["All course meetings are planned to be face-to-face.<BR/>Course Introduction.<BR/>What is ethnography?", "1 hour"], "第2回": ["Introducing cultural learning into language learning.<BR/>Research method: Participant observation.", "1 hour"], "第3回": ["Ethnography for linguists.<BR/>Research method: Interviewing.", "1 hour"], "第4回": ["Famous examples of ethnography in history.<BR/>Examples of student ethnographic projects.", "1 hour"], "第5回": ["Examples of ethnography in pop culture, written text.<BR/>Examples of ethnography in pop culture, video.", "1 hour"], "第6回": ["Explanation of main project.<BR/>Brainstorming project ideas.", "1 hour"], "第7回": ["Review of data collection techniques.<BR/>Comparing classmates project ideas.", "1 hour"], "第8回": ["How to consolidate different types of qualitative data.<BR/>How to code data.", "1 hour"], "第9回": ["How put coded data into a useable form.<BR/>How to construct a report.", "1 hour"], "第10回": ["Aspects of interaction to include in your report and presentation.<BR/>Troubleshooting problems with data, writing or presentation.", "1 hour"], "第11回": ["Final project presentations.", "1 hour"], "第12回": ["Final project presentations.", "1 hour"], "第13回": ["Submission of final written portfolio.<BR/>Peer review of written portfolio.", "1 hour"], "第14回": ["Return of all work and marks.<BR/>Make up tests or presentations as required. <BR/>University surveys, reflection, and feedback.", ""]}, "評価": {"教科書Required texts0": "No textbook.", "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["その他／Others (99)", "100 %", "See below."], "成績評価Grading2": "備考　Note\n30% Homework\n30% Project Presentation\n40% Portfolio", "更新日時/Date of Update0": "2022年02月15日 22時51分02秒", "項番No.0": [], "項番No.1": ["2022年度", "秋学期／Fall", "金曜１時限／Friday 1", "秋学期／Fall", "４別－２０３"]}, "campas": 0, "name": "【300】Language and Communication　１３／Language and Communication", "管理部署": 20, "単位数": 2, "担当者": "ウィルキンス　Ｍ．（WILKINS MICHAEL） ", "履修基準年度": "１年", "緊急授業形態": 0, "オンライン授業形態": 2, "時限1": 28, "評価1": 4, "開講期": 2}
