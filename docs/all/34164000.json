{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "We will study the Japanese Economy through historical and socio-economic perspectives. The emergence of Japan as an economic super power was long admired by the rest of the world, especially being the model of developing countries. However, Japan has been challenged by economic stagnation after the burst of asset price bubble in 1990s. Japan was the first in the world to fall into sustained deflation in modern era. In the recent years, `Abenomics` has gained considerable attention and aimed to exit deflation and raise growth.  <br />Hence, in this course, we will first look back on the progress of the postwar Japanese economy. This covers Japan’s period of postwar recovery, high economic growth, the bursting of the bubble economy and lost decade(s). Then, we will discuss issues and challenges that face the Japanese today`s economy, including labor markets, demographic issues, Japanese trade, Japanese industrial structure.", "到達目標": "Through these lectures, students will be able to <br />- gain an understanding of the historical underpinning of the Japanese economic development.<br />- explain and analyze the issues pertaining to the Japanese economy", "特記事項": "【合併】Japanese Economy（国際学部）/総合日本学習科目（経済）（CIEC）", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Lecture", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Face to face format for All 14 lectures<br /><br />Introduction: an overview of the Japan’s macroeconomic performance", "DF: Chapter 1<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第2回": ["Economic History: Postwar Recovery (1945-1949)", "KO: Chapter 10<br />DF: Chapter 4<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第3回": ["Economics History: High economic growth period (1950s-1970s)", "KO: Chapter 11<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第4回": ["Economic History: Economic Maturity (1970s-1980s)", "KO: Chapter 12<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第5回": ["Economic History: Bubble economy and recessionary economy (1990s ~ )", "KO: Chapter 13<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第6回": ["Abeonomics", "Please spend one hour to check news from reliable sources in order to assimilate the contents of this course."], "第7回": ["Industry Policy", "DF: Chapter 9<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第8回": ["Midterm Exam", ""], "第9回": ["Labor Market&nbsp;", "DF: Chapter 16<br />Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents."], "第10回": ["Demographic Issues", "Students are expected to spend 2 hours in preparation and reviewing the course contents.
