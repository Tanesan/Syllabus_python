You greatly enhance your acquisition of English by speaking it. In addition, speaking Japanese limits your classmates’ learning opportunities. Please encourage each other to speak English. You lose participation points if you speak Japanese in class. Students can expect to meet in a computer lab at least one time a week. Students can expect 2-3 hours of homework per week. This might increase slightly around important presentation deadlines.<br /><br />For Students permitted to take classes online: Due to the evolving public health situation, and in line with KGU policy, this course will be offered \"on-demand\" for those students permitted to do so. Please check your @kwansei.ac.jp email address regularly. I will be using my email address (kangaku.classes@gmail.com) so, please check that these emails are read. We will try to cover most of the course contents outlined below but this will probably be asynchronously (I will specify the deadline when I set the assignment). Do not worry, there will be some misunderstandings, and we will work through these issues together as best as we can.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Session 1-General introduction to academic English including: Academic Word List (AWL) review and critical thinking skills<br />All sessions are conducted face-to-face.", "Background research assignment (1.5 Hours)"], "第2回": ["Session 2-Academic writing: sample model & discussion of style; Writing prompt", "Academic language task 1 (1.5 Hours)"], "第3回": ["Session 3-Academic reading: text analysis and structure; Reading skills introduction; Reading prompt", "Reading assignment 1 (1.5 Hours)"], "第4回": ["Session 4-Reading skills session; Theme-based discussion", "Academic language task 2 (1.5 Hours)"], "第5回": ["Session 5-Reflective learning & study skills awareness through the use of electronic portfolios", "Metacognitive learning activity (1.5 Hours)"], "第6回": ["Session 6-Seminar skills: Cultures of learning; Academic language task", "Cultures of learning assignment (1.5 Hours)"], "第7回": ["Session 7-Reading skills session; Academic reading circles: Peer teaching", "Listening log 1 (.5 Hours)"], "第8回": ["Session 8-Seminar skills: Cultures of learning; E-portfolio: Study skills exercise", "Academic language task 3 (1.5 Hours)"], "第9回": ["Session 9-Reading skills session; Academic reading circles: Peer teaching", "Listening log 2 (1.5 Hours)"], "第10回": ["Session 10-Critical thinking task; E-portfolio: Study skills exercise", "Research analysis task (1.5 Hours)"], "第11回": ["Session 11-Critical thinking task; Individual research project (Q & A: Analysis of Situation-Problem-Solution-Evaluation (SPRE) model", "Research task 1 (1.5 Hours)"], "第12回": ["Session 12-SPRE writing task#1; E-portfolio: Study skills exercise; Academic language task", "Research task 2 (1.5 Hours)"], "第13回": ["Session 13-Research Presentation: Situation (background)", "Research task 3 (1.5 Hours)"], "第14回": ["Session 14-E-portfolio: Study skills exercise;", "Academic language task 4 (1.5 Hours)"], "第15回": ["Session 15-Mini lecture: Lecture learning strategies", "Note-taking assignment (1.5 Hours)"], "第16回": ["Session 16-SPRE writing task#2; E-portfolio: Study skills exercise", "Academic language task 5 (1.5 Hours)"], "第17回": ["Session 17-Research Presentation: Problem (issue)", "Research reflection (3 Hours)"], "第18回": ["Session 18-E-portfolio: Study skills exercise", "Academic language task 6 (3 Hours)"], "第19回": ["Session 19-Mini lecture: Learning groups", "Writing assignment 1 (1.5 Hours)"], "第20回": ["Session 20-SPRE writing task#3; E-portfolio: study skills exercise", "Academic language task 6 (1.5 Hours)"], "第21回": ["Session 21-Research Presentation: Solution (response)", "Writing assignment 2 (1.5 Hours)"], "第22回": ["Session 22-E-portfolio: study skills exercise", "Academic language task 7 (1.5 Hours)"], "第23回": ["Session 23-Mini lecture: Seminar discussion", "Discussion reflection (1.5 Hours)"], "第24回": ["Session 24-E-portfolio: study skills exercise", "Academic language task 8 (1.5 Hours)"], "第25回": ["Session 25-Final research presentation: Evaluation (including all of the SPRE model)", "Presentation reflection (1.5 Hours)"], "第26回": ["Session 26-E-portfolio: study skills exercise", "Academic language task 9 (1.5 Hours)"], "第27回": ["Session 27-Final research presentation: Evaluation (including all of the SPRE model)", "Course Reflection (1.5 Hours)"], "第28回": ["Session 28-Course review", ""]}, "評価": {"1": ["", ""], "2": ["", ""], "3": ["", ""], "4": ["", ""], "5": ["", ""], "6": ["", ""], "7": ["", ""], "8": ["", ""], "9": ["", ""], "10": ["", ""], "11": ["", ""], "12": ["", ""], "13": ["", ""], "14": ["", ""], "15": ["", ""], "16": ["", ""], "17": ["", ""], "18": ["", ""], "19": ["", ""], "20": ["", ""], "21": ["", ""], "22": ["", ""], "23": ["", ""], "24": ["", ""], "25": ["", ""], "26": ["", ""], "27": ["", ""], "28": ["", ""], "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["その他／Others (99)", "100 %", "40% participation and homework assignments; 30% oral assignments 30% written assignments"], "項番No.0": [], "項番No.1": ["2023年度", "秋学期／Fall", "月曜３時限／Monday 3", "秋学期／Fall", "Ｇ－２２６"], "項番No.2": ["2023年度", "秋学期／Fall", "金曜２時限／Friday 2", "秋学期／Fall", "ＭＲ－２０３"]}, "campas": 0, "name": "【250】Skills-based English(Academic)L4　２／Skills-based English(Academic)L4", "管理部署": 20, "単位数": 2, "担当者": "ヒギンズ　Ｒ．Ｍ．（HIGGINS ROBERT MICHAEL） ", "履修基準年度": "１年", "履修登録方法": "申込制(他条件あり)", "緊急授業形態": 0, "オンライン授業形態": 2, "時限1": 2, "時限2": 29, "評価1": 6, "開講期": 2}
