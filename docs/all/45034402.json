You greatly enhance your acquisition of English by speaking it. In addition, speaking Japanese limits your classmates’ learning opportunities. Please encourage each other to speak English. You lose participation points if you speak Japanese in class. Students can expect to meet in a computer lab at least one time a week. Students can expect 2-3 hours of homework per week. This might increase slightly around important presentation deadlines.<BR/><BR/>For Students permitted to take classes online: Due to the evolving public health situation, and in line with KGU policy, this course will be offered &quot;on-demand&quot; for those students permitted to do so. Please check your @kwansei.ac.jp email address regularly. I will be using my email address (kangaku.classes@gmail.com) so, please check that these emails are read. We will try to cover most of the course contents outlined below but this will probably be asynchronously (I will specify the deadline when I set the assignment).
