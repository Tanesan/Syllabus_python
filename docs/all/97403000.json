On this basis, and assuming students taking the course are prepared to engage actively with the learning materials, students should become more confident in:<BR/>?Demonstrating a critical appreciation of diverse social, cultural, sub-cultural and virtual identities relevant to contexts for CCM<BR/>?Making - and justifying - decisions that impact on the work and learning of people from diverse social and cultural backgrounds: e.g. in virtual project teams <BR/>?Applying skills and competencies relevant towards pursuing a global career in organisational management and business leadership", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "International Management; Organisational Behaviour", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "In-class and (if required) on-line; on-line discussions (LUNA)", "トピック": {"第1回": ["What is ‘cross-cultural management’ (CCM)?<BR/>Discussion questions include:<BR/>?What is distinctive about ‘cross-cultural management’ (CCM) as a style of strategic management?
