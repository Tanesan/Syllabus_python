Although the main topic of the seminar is related to technology, not all students are expected to become technologists.  As a matter of fact, it is expected and anticipated that some of the students will work on other specs such as technology policy and entrepreneurship.  This year, some of those technologies include:<br />1) tablet platforms (iPad, Galaxy, etc), <br />2) smartphones (iPhone, Android, etc),<br />3) smart phones applications (games, utilities, etc)<br />4) gaming platforms (Wii, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4, Xbox 720), <br />5) 3D character animation (Blender, etc)<br />6) social networking apps (for Facebook, Mixi, etc)<br />7) educational technologies<br />8) blockchain and other distributed-ledger technologies<br />9) immersive virtual reality with head-mounted displays<br />10) augmented reality with head-mounted displays and smartphones<br />11) drone technologies<br />12) collaborative emergency response technologies", "到達目標": "Students will:<br />1) Work on advisor-directed research projects<br />2) Learn useful research techniques based on the scientific method<br />3) Work on groups of 2 or more to develop their research themes more efficiently<br />4) Write academic papers using standard writing tools<br />5) Programming skills<br />6) Surveying skills", "特記事項": "本授業科目は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”ではありません。<br />The course is not subject to the 60-credit limit for online courses.", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "進級論文・卒業論文の研究テーマ選定を学ぶ実践的な授業です。 1年目は、進級論文研究テーマの選定、テーマの整理、チームプロジェクトにおけるチームメンバーの選定、プレゼンテーション、研究目標と成功指標の立案などを中心に学びます。 2年目は1年目のフォローアップとして、卒業論文研究プロジェクトを実現させることが期待されます。 1年次には文章での提出が求められますが、2年次には、卒論を提出するか、研究の成果物を実際にデジタルデータとして提出するか、どちらかになります。 例えば、ゲーム、音楽トラック、アニメーション、ウェブサービスなどです。<br /><br />This is a hands-on class in which students will learn to select a research theme for their junior-year term papers and their senior graduation thesis.  The first year focuses on selecting a research subject, organizing the subject, selecting team members for team projects, making presentations, and planning the research goals and success indicators.  The second year is a follow-up to the first year, where the students are expected to bring the research project to fruition.  While during the first year, the students are expected to submit their work in writing, in the second year, the students can either submit a written thesis or the actual product of their research in digital form.  For example, a game, a music track, an animation, a web service, etc.", "授業方法": "学生発表、個人及びチーム・プロジェクトを含む。<br />原則的に対面授業形式ですが、オンライン授業の許可を得ている学生のために、同時双方向型オンラインで授業します。全ての授業はZoomにて収録し、Lunaサイトで後からも見ることができます。<br /><br />Requires student presentations and individual and team projects.<br />In essence, the class format is face-to-face, but for students who have permission for online classes, the class will be taught in a simultaneous interactive online format.
