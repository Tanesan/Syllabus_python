{"履修期": "春学期集中", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course has both substantive and procedural objectives. Substantively, this course provides an overview of international relations in the East Asian region while introducing students the leading theories and debates about regional cooperation in the ﬁeld of international relations (IR). Procedurally, students are expected to write an analytical essay that demonstrates a clearly articulated research question and thesis statement. The thesis is to be supported by logical and empirical evidence, and not merely opinion. The essay is to be well researched and written in a polished and grammatical style.", "到達目標": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to<br />•\texplain the historical context of politics and IR of East Asia, <br />•\tanalyze issues related to politics and IR of East Asia, and <br />•\tdiscuss the manners in which U.S. foreign policy shapes and is shaped by politics and IR of East Asia.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "This course will examine the various tensions between the establishment of closer ties among the nations in East Asia and the preservation of national sovereignty. For the last few decades, there have remained lingering signs of regional conﬂict and signiﬁcant risks of the next war in East Asia (e.g., the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula, the East and South China Seas, etc.). Then the Russian invasion of Ukraine changed this expectation, and now the world is watching how two of the major countries in East Asia, China and Japan, respond to the challenge to the existing international order that happened in Europe. The central question is whether the East Asian region is heading towards greater peace and cooperation or war and conﬂict in the twenty-ﬁrst century. The subtitle of the course includes a question mark because all of us, including the instructor, are searching for answers.<br /><br />For the purposes of this course, East Asia is deﬁned as the region encompassing the Russian Far East, China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Since it has been extensively involved in the region since the 1850s, we will also focus on the role of the United States in the region. We may make occasional reference to India, but South Asia and Central Asia are not a primary focus of this class.", "授業方法": "添付ファイル参照<br />See Attached File", "トピック": {"第1回": ["1.
