{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of theories, concepts, and practices of organizational behavior. An organization is a collection of people who work together to achieve individual and organizational goals. In the future, most of the students will engage in some organizations either as owners, managers, or employees. So, it is important to understand how people behave in an organizational setting. In this course, students will learn how individuals and groups act in organizations and how organizations respond to the rapid changes in their external environment.", "到達目標": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to: <BR/>a) Understand the concepts and theories of Organizational Behavior (OB)<BR/>b) Identify and evaluate contemporary OB challenges faced by managers. <BR/>c) Comprehend OB from three levels: the individual, the group, and the organization. <BR/>d) Apply the theories of OB to analyze the organizational environment and solve case studies. <BR/>e) Facilitate group discussions and team work on issues relevant to OB. <BR/>f) Communicate their findings clearly and effectively using a variety of media.", "授業方法": "Classes of this course will be conducted face-to-face in the classroom. The online class participants will receive online simultaneous interactive delivery during class time. <BR/><BR/>Teaching and learning methods would be a mixture of lectures, readings, and in-class exercises such as chapter cases, team discussions, and student presentations of cases. In every session, we will cover a particular chapter from the textbook. In general, each session is divided into two halves. In the first half, I typically follow a conventional lecture-based approach covering the concepts and theories of the relevant chapter. The second half is normally devoted to related group exercise or chapter case analysis.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Overview of the course <BR/><BR/>What is Organizational Behavior?", "Read the course outline carefully"], "第2回": ["Attitudes and Job Satisfaction", "Read chapter 3 from the textbook"], "第3回": ["Emotions and Moods, Personality and Values", "Read chapter 4 and 5 from the textbook"], "第4回": ["Perception and Individual Decision Making", "Read chapter 6 from the textbook"], "第5回": ["Motivation", "Read chapter 7 and 8 from the textbook"], "第6回": ["Foundations of Group Behavior<BR/><BR/>Understanding Work Teams", "Read chapter 9 and 10 from the textbook"], "第7回": ["Leadership", "Read chapter 12 from the textbook"], "第8回": ["Power and Politics", "Read chapter 13 from the textbook"], "第9回": ["Conflict and Negotiation", "Read chapter 14 from the textbook"], "第10回": ["Organizational Culture", " Read chapter 16 from the textbook"], "第11回": ["Students&#39; presentations", "Preparation for presentation"], "第12回": ["Students&#39; presentations", "Preparation for presentation"], "第13回": ["Human Resource Policies and Practices", "Read chapter 17 from the textbook"], "第14回": ["Organizational Change and Stress Management", "Read chapter 18 from the textbook"]}, "評価": {"教科書/Required texts0": ["著者名\nAuthor", "タイトル\nTitle", "発行所\nPublisher", "出版年\nYear of Publication", "ISBN", "ボタン\nButton"], "教科書/Required texts1": ["Stephen Robbins and Timothy Judge", "Organizational Behavior", "Pearson Education", "2018 年", "ISBN-13 :978-1292259239", ""], "教科書Required texts0": "Stephen Robbins and Timothy Judge, Organizational Behavior, Global Edition, 2018, Pearson Education, ISBN-13 :978-1292259239.", "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["平常リポート／Individual reports (04)", "40 %", "Report Final Examination"], "成績評価Grading2": ["その他／Others (99)", "60 %", "Class Participation 30%, Case Presentation 30%"], "更新日時/Date of Update0": "2021年01月14日 18時28分56秒", "項番No.0": [], "項番No.1": ["2021年度", "秋学期／Fall", "月曜１時限／Monday 1", "秋学期／Fall", "Ｇ－ＩＳ１０６"]}, "開講キャンパス": "西宮上ケ原キャンパス／Nishinomiya Uegahara Campus", "【科目ナンバー/Course Number】授業名称": "【330】Management B／Management B", "管理部署": "国際学部/International Studies／School of International Studies", "単位数": "2", "担当者": "アクター　タスリマ（AKHTER TASLIMA） ", "履修基準年度": "１年", "時限1": "月曜１時限／Monday 1", "開講期": "秋学期／Fall"}
