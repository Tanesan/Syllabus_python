The focus of this class is vocabulary, speaking, grammar, listening and reading.  In each lesson, students will develop their ability to communicate in English by speaking in pairs or in small groups.  The content of the lesson is based on the textbook, but students will sometimes participate in extra communication activities.  Students should be prepared for frequent discussion activities, in which they will learn and practice appropriate language for a range of communication situations (for example: asking for opinions, expressing opinions, disagreeing, offering advice, persuading others, etc.). Students will be expected to participate in an 'English only' learning environment.", "授業方法": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" times=\"times\" new=\"new\" roman\",serif;\"=\"roman',serif;'\" style=\"margin:0cm;font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;\">We will be a face-to-face class.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" times=\"times\" new=\"new\" roman\",serif;\"=\"roman',serif;'\" style=\"margin:0cm;font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;\">The instructor will be a facilitator of various tasks to help students connect with each other and speak English.
