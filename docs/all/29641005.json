There are weekly academic readings (e.g., an academic journal article in English) related to seminar themes and preparation assignments for students to complete. During the meetings, there are mini-lectures, in-depth discussions, and brief student presentations on those readings and topics. In the second part of the semester, students mainly work in small groups. They conduct literature research on an assigned seminar topic, organize and give a group presentation, and lead a full seminar meeting on that topic. Throughout the semester, students reflect on their own seminar research interests and work toward identifying their specific Junior Thesis research topic. <br /><br />Summer: Students begin reading the relevant literature for their selected Junior Thesis research topic and write an annotated bibliography. <br /><br />Fall: The primary focus in the fall semester is developing the Junior Thesis, which is a research proposal. Students read extensively on their selected research topic, lead discussions on their topic, write / receive peer and instructor feedback / revise drafts of their Junior Thesis, and give individual presentations on their Junior Thesis project. Throughout the semester, students receive guidance on academic thesis research and writing. Students also join as audience members at the Research Fair in November to support and learn about their senior seminar members' Graduation Thesis research.", "授業外学習2": "Student preparation outside of class meetings includes:<br />(1) Weekly preparation assignments, including carefully reading English academic journal articles and completing preparation tasks,<br />(2) Conducting literature research on seminar and Junior Thesis topics,<br />(3) Preparation for leading and participating in discussions,<br />(4) Preparation for individual and group presentations, and<br />(5) Writing, using peer and instructor feedback, and revising Junior Thesis drafts.<br /><br />Fieldwork Trip:<br />There will likely be a domestic or overseas fieldwork trip related to the themes of this seminar either in the 3rd or 4th year.
