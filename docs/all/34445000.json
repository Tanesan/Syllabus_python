{"履修期": "秋学期前半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "<span style=\"vertical-align:inherit;\"><span style=\"vertical-align:inherit;\">This course focuses on concepts, theories, and empirics on corporate governance on a COIL (collaborative online international learning) framework with a particular reference to Japan and an emerging economy, Bangladesh. In this course, the students will learn the bank-based monitoring system, commonly known as the integrated monitoring system deployed by Japan's Main Bank System, Bank of Japan, and the Ministry of Finance, to ensure effective governance of corporations. Simultaneously, the course will examine the market-based monitoring system practiced in the USA and the UK. The course will shed light on the governance system of an emerging economy, considering Bangladesh as a case. Three professors from three different Universities in Bangladesh would offer seven sessions to discuss corporate governance practices in emerging economies with some of their research students. The course will review the efficacy of the three pillars of corporate governance, such as board composition, ownership structure, and audit structure, to examine their applicability in Japanese culture. Also, the course will discuss how governance mechanisms impact family and non-family firms, corporate social behavior, and global citizenship.</span></span>", "到達目標": "<span style=\"vertical-align:inherit;\"><span style=\"vertical-align:inherit;\">After completing the course, students will learn how the bank-based or creditor-based governance system and market-based governance mechanisms impact monitoring and controlling modern corporations' opportunistic behavior.
