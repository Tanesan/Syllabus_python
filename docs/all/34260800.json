{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "Extending the course ‘Introduction to European Economic History’ that ends with a class on the destruction of Europe’s economy during the 2nd World War, this course will focus solely on the post-war development of the European economy and on the process of European economic integration. With this focus, the course intends to especially highlight the economic effects of European integration beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 until the recent Euro crisis in 2009/10 and its aftermath. The genuine purpose and aim of this course are to present European economic integration to students not as an inevitable, smooth process, but as an often very difficult one accompanied by various crises, which so far, however, have all be resolved due to a shared perception amongst member states that European integration provides an overall added value to all member states, for which to achieve sometimes also sacrifices are necessary to make. The applied perspective of the course is an economic historical one, focusing particularly on issues how living standards and living conditions of Europeans have changed due to the European project.", "到達目標": "Students are to acquire a broad general knowledge about the European Union’s economic development from the 1950s until today. Students should know the main steps of European economic integration and should be able to explain the main economic effects of this integration process. Students should become aware of the many difficulties and obstacles with which the EU and its member states have been constantly confronted with in their efforts to further pursue European integration. This knowledge should enable students also to put economic cooperation and integration in other world regions for instance South-East Asia (ASEAN) better into perspective.", "特記事項": "本授業科目は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”ではありません。 The course is not subject to the 60-credit limit for online courses.", "関連科目": "All courses qualifying for the EUIJ certificate program for undergraduate students", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Face-to-face in-class lectures.
