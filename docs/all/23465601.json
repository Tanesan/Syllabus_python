The instructor will take this into account when giving students a participation grade.\n2c) Being 15 to 29 minutes late will equal half an absence (0.5).\n2d) Each time students are late 30 minutes or more, they will be marked absent. However, they are still encouraged to attend.\n2e) As a general rule, no more than three absences will be permitted in this course.", "備考Note0": "The use of smartphones in class is strictly forbidden.
