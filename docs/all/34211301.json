{"履修期": "春学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course is designed for students who are interested in the issues of gender, ethnicity/race, and sexuality. Although resolution of these issues is important for those seeking happiness in their lives, they have never formed part of mainstream debate. During the class we will consider why this is the case through readings and discussion. The class will be conducted in a seminar format with students being expected to raise discussion points and to give presentations. The goal is to enable them to acquire basic concepts and to gain knowledge of related theories.", "到達目標": "To be aware of the unseen prejudice that surrounds us.", "特記事項": "本授業科目は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”ではありません。 The course is not subject to the 60-credit limit for online courses.", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Seminar", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Week 1: Introduction to the class.<br />Face to face format for All 14 lectures.", "N/A"], "第2回": ["Week 2: Key concepts.", "N/A"], "第3回": ["Week 3: A brief history of the women’s movement.", "N/A"], "第4回": ["Week 4: Ideology and power.", "N/A"], "第5回": ["Week 5: Racism and representation.", "N/A"], "第6回": ["Week 6: Women in the media.", "N/A"], "第7回": ["Week 7: Sexual minorities in the media.", "N/A"], "第8回": ["Week 8: Debate topics to be decided in class.", "N/A"], "第9回": ["Week 9: Women in Asia I.", "N/A"], "第10回": ["Week 10: Women in Asia II.", "N/A"], "第11回": ["Week 11: Women in North America I.", "N/A"], "第12回": ["Week 12: Women in North America II.", "N/A"], "第13回": ["Week 13: Students’ final presentations.", "N/A"], "第14回": ["Week 14: Students’ final presentations and class evaluation", "N/A"], "授業外学習2": "N/A"}, "評価": {"1": ["", ""], "2": ["", ""], "3": ["", ""], "4": ["", ""], "5": ["", ""], "6": ["", ""], "7": ["", ""], "8": ["", ""], "9": ["", ""], "10": ["", ""], "11": ["", ""], "12": ["", ""], "13": ["", ""], "14": ["", ""], "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["平常リポート／Individual reports (04)", "60 %", "Presentation"], "成績評価Grading2": ["その他／Others (99)", "40 %", "Participation"], "項番No.0": [], "項番No.1": ["2023年度", "春学期／Spring", "火曜１時限／Tuesday 1", "春学期／Spring", "Ｇ－ＩＳ院３"]}, "campas": 0, "name": "【310】Special Topics in Culture and Language【Representation, gender and ethnicity】　１／Special Topics in Culture and Language [EN]", "管理部署": 10, "単位数": 2, "担当者": "李　恩子（LEE EUN JA） ", "履修基準年度": "２年", "履修登録方法": "本登録", "緊急授業形態": 0, "オンライン授業形態": 1, "時限1": 7, "評価1": 3, "評価2": 6, "開講期": 1}
