Germany has always been equated as a model country for Japan in overcoming the history issue. Germany for most of its part reconciled with the victim countries. Why was it possible? What kind of reconciliation measures were taken by Germany? What are the reactions coming from the victim countries? Apology and forgiveness are the crucial elements for a successful reconciliation process. We would like to discuss key factors leading to reconciliation by comparing Germany and Japan.

However, there are constitutional constraints, when Japan dispatches self-defense forces beyond its territory for the purpose of UN Peace Operations including UN-PKO and other military activities to maintain peace. In Japan, the issue of the right to collective self-defense has always been argued in connection with the dispatch of the Self-Defense Forces outside Japan. Whether Japan has overcome this issue, though not completely but to a certain degree?

Together with the weakening of the liberal world order the voices over \"Decline of the West\" could be heard.  What will be the influence of this geopolitical trend in Europe to Japan? We will be examining possible negative impact of this and thinking how this trend could be reversed. The role of Japan and the EU/European countries to cope with the division of the world or decoupling of the US and China, will also be discussed.   <br /><br />PPT materials will be made available, however internet-based search before the class could be useful.<br /><br />Reading materials:<br />Max Bergmann, \"Europe's Geopolitical Awakening\", Foreign Affairs, August 27, 2020", "Students are asked to visit the home page of the EU(Headquarter) or the Delegation of EU in Tokyo to get information before the class."], "第9回": ["Nov.17 \"The United Nations at crossroad: its 78 years history and the possibilities and limitations of the UN\"<br />The UN has not been functioning well for a long time as the UN Charter envisages. This being the case because of the Cold War in the past and due to the self-centered behavior of the 5 Permanent Members(P5) of the UN Security Council for many years. Taking examples of Ukraine, Syria, Iran and the disarmament issues, particularly nuclear disarmament, the Security Council has not been a main actor when strategic interests of the P5 and 5 Nuclear Weapon countries are at stake. This has also been the case in such field of non- military nature as climate change (Paris Agreement) or Pandemic of Coronavirus. We have, however a challenging UN initiative like SDGs.

However, the Security Council could not always comply with this request and the reform was called for over the years. After the demise of the Cold War, Japan embarked on the reform course and started a new campaign in 1992. Japan, Germany, Brazil, and India created a Draft Resolution (G4 Resolution) for the reform of the Security Council in 2005. However, after hectic negotiations in the General Assembly, G4 was obliged to abandon to put this draft resolution for voting. Since then, the negotiations have been conducted every year in the GA, but it is going nowhere. What are the key issues and why the negotiations stagnate? We will be examining this complicated political issue and discussing how the member countries are able to cut the Gordian's Knot.
