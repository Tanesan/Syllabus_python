Specific objectives of the course are to have students: become aware of their own biases and prejudices; be exposed to and learn from minority populations in Japan and other countries; be sensitized to intolerance that is based on race or ethnicity; consider ways to handle these issues in an increasingly global, diverse, changing society.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Course format will include readings, lectures, guest lecturers, facilitated discussions, and media and communications analyses.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction - Course content review and class introductions <br />(In-class writing assignment #1)", ""], "第2回": ["Lecture on Intercultural relations - some fundamentals", "Relevant readings will be assigned in September."], "第3回": ["&nbsp;Lecture on cultural bias, prejudice, unconscious bias, and racism - examining self and media<br />(In-class group assignment #1)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in September."], "第4回": ["&nbsp;Lecture &amp; discussion – Learning from history<br />(Student assignment #1 due)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in September."], "第5回": ["Lecture &amp; discussion – Intercultural Communication – theory and practice", "Relevant readings will be assigned in October."], "第6回": ["Lecture &amp; discussion – Human rights – Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion <br />(In-class group assignment #2)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in October."], "第7回": ["Lecture &amp; discussion – Indigenous peoples - Canadian context and beyond by guest lecturer (virtual)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in October."], "第8回": ["Lecture &amp; discussion – Minority peoples in Japan<br />(Student assignment #2 due)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in November."], "第9回": ["&nbsp;Lecture &amp; discussion – Minority issues in Japan, by guest lecturer (virtual)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in November."], "第10回": ["Lecture &amp; discussion – Laws, policies, and practices - some case studies", "Relevant readings will be assigned in November."], "第11回": ["&nbsp;Lecture &amp; discussion – Modelling intercultural relations – best practices<br />(Student assignment #3 due)", "Relevant readings will be assigned in November."], "第12回": ["Student presentations / paper summary readings&nbsp;", "Relavant readings to be selected by students."], "第13回": ["Student presentations / paper summary readings", "Relevant readings to be selected by students."], "第14回": ["Student presentations / paper summary readings&nbsp;<div>Concluding remarks and evaluation</div>", "Relevant readings to be selected by students."], "授業外学習2": "Students are encouraged to pay attention to intercultural affairs and learn about some cultural norms, biases, and racism in their local and global contexts."}, "評価": {"0": "", "1": ["", ""], "2": ["", ""], "3": ["", ""], "4": ["", ""], "5": ["", ""], "6": ["", ""], "7": ["", ""], "8": ["", ""], "9": ["", ""], "10": ["", ""], "11": ["", ""], "12": ["", ""], "13": ["", ""], "14": ["", ""], "15": "", "教科書Required texts0": "Still to be determined.", "参考書/Reference books0": ["著者名\nAuthor", "タイトル\nTitle", "発行所\nPublisher", "出版年\nYear of Publication", "ISBN", "ボタン\nButton"], "参考書/Reference books1": ["Fatima Pirbhai-Illich, Shauneen Pete, Fran Martin eds.", "Culturally Responsive Pedagogy: Working towards Decolonization, Indigeneity and Interculturalism", "Palgrave MacMillan", "2018 年", "978-3319834924", ""], "参考書/Reference books2": ["Patrick Janssen", "Intercultural Competences", "Part of: Routledge-Noordhoff International Editions (43 books)", "2019 年", "978-9001893101", ""], "参考文献・資料Reference books0": "Additional references to follow.", "学生による授業評価の方法Course Evaluation by Students0": "KGU evaluation and in-class peer reviews, feedback, and collaboration.", "学位授与の方針との関連Relationship to Diploma Policy1": "This course satisfies \"Skills of Understanding and analyzing international affairs,\" \"Skills of finding and solving problems\" and \"Intercultural understanding skills and multicultural adaptability\" of the Diploma Policies.\n\n各授業科目は、各学部・研究科の定めるディプロマ・ポリシー（DP）・カリキュラム・ポリシー（CP）に基づき、カリキュラム上に配置されています。\nDP・CPを意識して本授業科目の学修を進めることで、各学部・研究科の期待する能力が養成されます。\n各学部・研究科のDP、CPや教育課程表（授業科目一覧等）は、下記リンクこちらに掲載していますので学修計画の参考にしてください。\nhttps://kwic.kwansei.ac.jp/cabinet/reference?typeCd=0&cabinetId=557&directLink=1\n※kwicへのリンクとなります（在学生のみ閲覧可）", "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["平常リポート／Individual reports (04)", "50 %", "In-class or take home assignments, group work, journals"], "成績評価Grading2": ["プレゼンテーション・発表／Presentation (07)", "30 %", "Class presentation or paper submission (summary to be presented)"], "成績評価Grading3": ["その他／Others (99)", "20 %", "participation in discussions based on readings, willing contributions, and on-time attendance"], "備考Note0": "* Guest lecture topics and dates are subject to change.
