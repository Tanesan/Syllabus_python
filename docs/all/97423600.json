Businesses across all industries are facing social and environmental challenges that will become even more pressing in the coming decade. The impact of climate change on businesses, limitations of traditional business model, a series of corporate scandals, and increasing regulations for social and environmental issues around the world have brought the sustainability into spotlight. Increasingly corporate executives must find new ways to address the social, economic, and environmental effects of doing business while balancing conflicting demands on their attention, time, and company resources. While the multinational companies are leading the practice, there has been growing discussion regarding the potential of family businesses and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) to embrace the practices of corporate sustainability.   <BR/>In this background this course aims to develop the knowledge and understanding of contemporary issues in the theory and practice of sustainability management, accounting, and accountability. Emphasizing the alignment of sustainability with core business strategy, this course help you define priorities, integrate sustainability throughout your business, and build social and business value.", "授業方法": "The course will be offered in &quot;Hy-flex&quot; format. In&quot;Hy-flex&quot; format, instructor will conduct the class in a classroom, and students are able to choose whether to take the course in the classroom or online, depending on his or her own choice. For online students, classes will be held at the time specified in the timetable via interactive live streaming using Zoom.<BR/>This course is quite reading intensive given that sustainability will be a new topic for most students. Readings include academic and managerial focused articles, book chapters, and reports in the field of sustainability management and accounting.<BR/>Study materials (i.e., power point slides) will be uploaded on LUNA one week in advance. Students are strongly encouraged to read the materials before joining the class. It would be helpful to note down the key concepts in each chapter to discuss in the class. <BR/>The format of this course is based on a mixture of lectures, readings, and in-class exercises such as chapter cases, team discussions, and student presentations of cases. <BR/>In each class, instructor will open the discussion on a particular topic by clarifying the key concepts and theories. All students are expected to be prepared for class and actively participate and contribute in class room discussion.   <BR/>Case analysis is a proven tool to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students. In this course, we will solve several mini case studies (from textbooks) and standard case studies (from Harvard Business Publishing). Therefore, success in this course significantly depends on your ability to analyze the given case studies.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Foundations of corporate sustainability", "Read the article “Creating Shared Value” by Michael E.
