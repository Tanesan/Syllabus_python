Preparation before class—reading the textbook, doing practice activities, and doing writing tasks on computer and submitting them in a proper format—is essential. In class, there will be some lecture, pair work (particularly for peer review of writing), feedback, and limited writing time.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Course Information: Overview via Course Information Sheet<BR/>Familiarization with platforms and expectations<BR/>Administrative Set-up", "An average of 60-90 minutes of homework/week will be assigned.
