{"履修期": "春学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course is designed to overview the major topics in the study of Japanese phonetics and phonology. Acquiring the manipulating skills of a sound analyzer by using a computer is also one of the objects to learn for this course. The areas covered in this course are mainly acoustic phonetics, articulatory phonetics, auditory phonetics, and phonology in which various sound-related phenomena are dealt with from a various points of view based on generalized rules. Since accentuation is difficult to learn as well as mora-timed rhythm in the course of the study of the language, this course places a focus on the teaching of the rules in pitch accent. So, this course may help students improve their pronunciation of Japanese a great deal.", "到達目標": "By overviewing the major topics in the study of Japanese phonetics and phonology, students are expected to fully understand the sound system composing the Japanese grammar. Specifically, students will become aware of various rules functioning for the pitch accent, the more-timed rhythm, sequential voicing, compounding, sound changes, intonation, etc. in the Japanese grammar. Furthermore, through this course, students will be able to fully understand the difference in sound system between English and Japanese.", "特記事項": "本授業科目は、“オンライン授業60単位制限対象科目”ではありません。 The course is not subject to the 60-credit limit for online courses.<br />【合併】総合日本学習科目（言語学：音声学・音韻論）（CIEC）/Japanese Phonetics and Phonology（国際学部）", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Face to face format.
