However, there are constitutional constraints in both countries, when they dispatch military forces beyond their territory for the UN Peace Operations including UNPKO and other military activities to maintain peace. Particularly in case of Japan, the issue of the right to collective self-defense has always been argued in connection to the dispatch of the Self-Defence Forces outside Japan.

He also supports extending the norms against nuclear weapons, and in that regard appeals to States that possess nuclear weapons to affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Finally, he proposes preparing for a world free of nuclear weapons through a number of risk -reduction measures, including transparency in nuclear-weapon programmes, further reductions in all types of nuclear weapons, commitments not to introduce new and destabilizing types of nuclear weapons, including cruise missiles, reciprocal commitments for the non-use of nuclear weapons and reduction of the role of nuclear weapons in security doctrines. We will discuss how international community, particularly the nuclear weapon states, can embark on a new stage of nuclear disarmament and what role should the United Nations and its member states, including Japan, play to promote this extraordinarily difficult political task.
