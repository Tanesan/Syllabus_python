{"履修期": "春学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course is meant to study basics and applications of molecular spectroscopy. Molecular spectroscopy is now widely used as a vital tool in various fields ranging from chemistry to materials science to biomedical science. This course is focused on several spectroscopic techniques including not only conventional techniques but also state-of-the-art techniques such as super-resolution microscopy and laser trapping. A focus is also placed on the applications of those techniques in scientific research.", "到達目標": "The course goal is to understand the quantum mechanical theory behind molecular spectroscopy and to learn about various molecular spectroscopic techniques and their applications in biomedical and materials sciences.", "授業方法": "Lecture, in-class presentation, and discussion<BR/>Two lectures on Raman spectroscopy are given by Shigeto and the other 12 lectures by Liu.<BR/>※Online lectures will be given, for details including ZOOM links please check LUNA.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction to molecular spectroscopy", ""], "第2回": ["Quantum mechanics and spectroscopy", ""], "第3回": ["UV/Visible absorption spectroscopy I", ""], "第4回": ["UV/Visible absorption spectroscopy II", ""], "第5回": ["Molecular luminescence spectroscopy", ""], "第6回": ["Super-resolution microscopy", ""], "第7回": ["Laser trapping", ""], "第8回": ["Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy", ""], "第9回": ["Infrared spectroscopy I", ""], "第10回": ["Infrared spectroscopy II", ""], "第11回": ["X-ray crystallography", ""], "第12回": ["Presentation in class", ""], "第13回": ["Raman spectroscopy I", ""], "第14回": ["Raman spectroscopy II", ""], "授業外学習2": "N/A"}, "評価": {"参考書/Reference books0": ["著者名\nAuthor", "タイトル\nTitle", "発行所\nPublisher", "出版年\nYear of Publication", "ISBN", "ボタン\nButton"], "参考書/Reference books1": ["P.
