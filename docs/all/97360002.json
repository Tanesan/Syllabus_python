For online students, classes will be held at the time specified in the timetable via interactive live streaming using Zoom.<br />Study materials (i.e., PowerPoint slides, exercises, and home assignments) will be uploaded on LUNA one week in advance. Students are strongly encouraged to read the materials before joining the class. It would be helpful to note down the key concepts in each chapter to discuss in class. <br />In each session, the instructor will first clarify the key concepts of a chapter/case to the students. Then, the students will solve a number of related problems. This process will ensure that the students acquire adequate technical competencies as well as comprehend the underlying rationale and effectiveness of accounting practices. <br />Individual assignments will be from end-of-chapter problems. On average, students should spend 3/4 hours working on each assignment. All homework assignments must be submitted to the instructor by e-mail. Students are required to identify difficulties while solving problems and to communicate them so that the instructor can discuss them.<br />Case analysis is a proven tool for developing students’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
