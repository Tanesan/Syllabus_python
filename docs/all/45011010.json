It serves as an intensive alternative to the standard English requirement, which generally takes two years and meets just once a week in large classes. <BR/>The main purpose of IE is to develop communicative ability by providing students opportunities for expressing and processing ideas and opinions in oral and written forms.  Toward this end, there is a focus on communication and interaction in class, and students work on building a wider knowledge of vocabulary. Small group activities and projects increase practice time for speaking English and give students the opportunity to develop cooperative learning skills. The course also introduces skills and strategies students can use in negotiating all aspects of English communication, including conversation, discussion, listening, reading, and writing. Finally, students are given the tools needed to learn to practice their English skills more independently and effectively. <BR/>Active all-English participation is required for success in this course, and at the end of IE-II, students of all sections are expected to have developed a degree of conversational confidence and competence well-beyond that of their average colleague.", "授業方法": "For AY 2022/2023 the plan is to teach face-to-face in the classroom with precautions to prevent the spread of covid. However, if the covid situation worsens there is a possibility that classes may be moved to partially or wholly online. The teacher will update you at that time in detail if that happens but in general classes would use Zoom, Luna, and other online tools.<BR/><BR/>Students will learn in a variety of modes. These modes will include individual work but collaborative learning in pairs and small groups will be the most common mode of study. Teacher centered activities will be kept short and few in number.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["All course meetings are planned to be face-to-face.<BR/>Week 1<BR/>Introduction to course objectives, schedule and materials.<BR/>Set up of all digital accounts and class rules and procedures.<BR/>Self-introductions and ice breakers.<BR/>Explanation of portfolio and first short written homework.<BR/>Explanation of CEFR system and start to practice CEFR A1 speaking tasks.<BR/>Explanation of Quizlet app and quiz system.", "2 Hours"], "第2回": ["Week 2<BR/>Explanation of English Central and first monthly assignment.<BR/>Explanation of free writing method and A1 topics.<BR/>Explanation of writing and presentation assignments later in the semester.<BR/>Explanation of the Xreader system and first monthly assignments.<BR/>Explanation of movie study and movie vocabulary.<BR/>Watch first scene of the movie.", "2 Hours"], "第3回": ["Week 3<BR/>A1 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scene two plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第4回": ["Week 4<BR/>A1 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scene two plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第5回": ["Week 5<BR/>A1 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scene two plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第6回": ["Week 6<BR/>Speaking Test One<BR/>English Central start assignment 2<BR/>Xreader assignment 2", "2 Hours"], "第7回": ["Week 7<BR/>A2 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scene two plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第8回": ["Week 8<BR/>A2 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scene two plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第9回": ["Week 9<BR/>A2 CEFR Topics.<BR/>Free writing and writing homework.<BR/>Movie scene two plus vocab study.<BR/>Speaking practice.<BR/>Quizlet quiz.", "2 Hours"], "第10回": ["Week 10<BR/>Speaking Test Two<BR/>English Central start assignment 3<BR/>Xreader assignment 3", "2 Hours"], "第11回": ["Week 11<BR/>Presentation project explanation.<BR/>Presentation group formation and topic selection.<BR/>Presentation preparation.", "2 Hours"], "第12回": ["Week 12<BR/>Student Presentations group A.<BR/>Student Presentations group B.<BR/>Student Presentations group C.", "2 Hours"], "第13回": ["Week 13<BR/>Final Quizlet quiz.<BR/>Final movie quiz.<BR/>Hand in Free writing booklet<BR/>Speaking Test Two with Peers<BR/>Final essay instructions and check.<BR/>Speaking Test Two with Teacher<BR/>Last English Central and Xreader assignment 3 deadline reminders.<BR/>Portfolio final preparation.", "2 Hours"], "第14回": ["Week 14<BR/>Portfolio peer evaluation day.<BR/>Portfolio collection by teacher.<BR/>Return of all student work.<BR/>Make up tests if needed.<BR/>Student reflections and feedback to teacher.<BR/>University questionnaires.", "2 Hours"], "授業外学習2": "Students will work outside of class equal to the time in class over the semester.
