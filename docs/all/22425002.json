Most sessions will begin with a short listening task, such as a dictation or listening comprehension. Then, in small groups, students will share their written homework assignments such as the journal content or English skit content. Following this, students will do individual, pair, and group work using the textbook. Then, if time allows, students will engage in some communicative activity that builds upon the content of the textbook. However, some sessions will be speaking checks, short quizzes on the textbook content, or English skit performances in place of the regular activities.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Introduction to the course.
