{"履修期": "春学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "In this course the students will learn about media specificity in Japanese historical context. This class offers an introduction to historical development of Japanese media, looking at the prominent media such as Heian period novel, Noh Theater, Edo popular literature, Kabuki Theater, film, anime and manga. Each media appeared in a specific historical period and served specific audiences. For example, Heian novel written in kana scrips appeared in aristocratic circles, Noh Theater became a celebrated art-form for military elite, while Kabuki became a form of proto-modern popular culture in Edo period. <BR/><BR/>Same plots and characters appear through the ages, as adaptations and citation. Texts, such as Genji Monogatari (Murasaki Shikibu), Heike Monogatari, myths and legends had been reimagined through picture-scrolls and traditional theatrical forms all the way to film, manga and anime. Each media adapted the recognizable contents to serve the historical period, intended audience’s aesthetic and ideological expectations.", "到達目標": "Throughout this course, we will look at development of Japanese traditional and contemporary media and their interrelation: adaptation, interpretation, media-mixes, relationships of the source and derivative materials, as well as the texts interaction with the reader.
