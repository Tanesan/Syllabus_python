{"履修期": "秋学期", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "This course is a continuation of our exploration of cross‑cultural communication. It deepens students’ understanding of English pragmatics by examining communication styles such as direct versus indirect approaches and politeness strategies across cultures. Students will investigate authentic texts, academic articles, and case studies to understand how language shapes and is shaped by cultural expectations. Throughout the semester, learners will conduct a research project and report the findings of their research, integrating theoretical insights with practical observations.", "到達目標": "By the end of the course, students will be able to:1. Analyze English Pragmatics: Explain key pragmatic concepts such as speech acts, implicature, and context, and evaluate their role in intercultural communication.2. Compare Communication Styles: Identify and compare direct and indirect communication approaches, discussing how these strategies are employed in Japanese, Western, and other cultural contexts.3. Evaluate Politeness Strategies: Critically examine theories of politeness and assess how these strategies function in various communication scenarios.4. Integrate Theory and Practice: Combine insights from pragmatic theory with real-world case studies to deepen understanding of cultural communication dynamics.5. Conduct and Report Research: Design and execute a research project on topics related to English pragmatics and cultural communication, and effectively report the findings of that research.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "Classes are conducted face-to-face in the classroom.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Course Introduction &amp; Overview• Review of cross‑cultural communication• Introduction to English pragmatics and cultural styles", ""], "第2回": ["Group Discussion.
