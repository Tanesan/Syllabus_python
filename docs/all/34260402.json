Consequently, the gap between developed and developing countries is widening, leaving millions of people in poverty and severe living conditions particularly in the developing world. Development Economics advances our understanding of the causes and consequences of such successes and failures in development. Thus, with the needs of students with varied academic backgrounds in mind, this course introduces the basic concepts and theories of development. Then we examine global trends of economic development with a focus on developing countries. The course further aims to deepen students' understanding of common problems among developing countries and policies to achieve development through a review of both domestic and international issues. The course is designed with a balance between the theoretical underpinnings and empirical analysis of contemporary development challenges.", "授業方法": "Students will receive the required readings one week before and the lecture notes after each session.
