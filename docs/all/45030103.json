There will be interesting discussions focused on the student&#39;s lives as well as presentations and short writing assignments.<BR/>This course is primarily designed for students who have TOEFL/TOEIC scores lower than the minimum required for registration into IE, but students who meet that requirement can still register for Basic if they desire low-level English practice. This course also functions to introduce students to LC courses and the personal benefits associated with studying abroad. The course is four-skills and meets once a week. Students will participate in pair work, group work, discussions and task based projects to assist them to develop both their English and classroom study skills.<BR/><BR/><BR/>Update: (information for students permitted to take classes online) The materials will be provided via PowerPoint slides and some video lectures of select classes.
