{"履修期": "春学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "The purpose of this course is to train students as strategy planners. The course is designed to enable students to be familiar with alternative firm or business strategies. We also discuss how to effectively implement alternative strategies by ensuring appropriate selection of skills, expertise, resources, organizational structure, incentive &amp; control mechanisms. The course also covers discussions on how strategic thinking relates to other major disciplines, including marketing as well as finance.", "到達目標": "Learning goals of this course are twofold. Firstly, students should be able to generate realistic and effective strategic alternatives for their organizations by considering their competitive contexts, available resources, as well as goals and missions of their organizations. Secondly, students should be able to articulate differential profit potential and associated risks of those strategic alternatives. Students will be encouraged to pay close attention to the challenge of implementing new strategic initiatives while they sustain smooth and efficient operation of ongoing business.", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "All lectures are conducted completely face-to-face.", "トピック": {"第1回": ["Positioning-based view (1): After a quick introduction of the course, we start the course by discussing what strategy planners should clarify to design effective strategy.

A resource-based view addresses this shortfall by analyzing organizations as bundle of unique resources.

In other words, the foregoing discussions are motivated by the question, \"why one organization is more competitive than the others?\", while more informative question for strategy planners may be \"how should one select from several alternative strategies?\".
