The European Union is stronger than ever with occasional disunity. NATO rediscovered its reason for being Guardian in geopolitical confrontations. The G7 is strengthening its solidarity. American hard power remains unrivaled but shaky because of the presidential elections. Dictatorships are stumbling while they’re becoming more consolidated. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is isolated for its leader to attend the G20 summit, facing serious economic and military decline ... while NATO has never looked stronger. Iran, Russia’s most important military ally, faces a deeply hostile geopolitical environment alongside the greatest domestic unrest since the 1979 revolution that brought the Islamic Republic to power. China was thoroughly unprepared for its socio-economic troubles with zero Covid, leading to unprecedented demonstrations ... and a sudden turnaround of President Xi Jinping’s policy. Their trajectories are, to varying degrees, increasingly unsustainable.<br /><br />The Eurasia Group, led by political analyst Mr. Ian Bremmer has been issuing for years a geopolitical risk report at the beginning of the year, which is known as EURASIA GROUP'S TOP RISKS for the year. Ten top risks of the year will be introduced as a forecast with some “Red Herrings”.<br />This introductory session will look the 2024 report and discuss the relevance of the analysis with critical thinking.<br /><br /><br />Reading Materials: <br /><br />EURASIA GROUP’S TOP RISKS FOR 2024<br />https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2024<br /><br />Note: Students are expected to come prepared for discussion with a speaking note (A4 1page) on the topic of their selection from the TOP RISKS report.

However, there are constitutional constraints in both countries, when they dispatch military forces beyond their territory for the UN Peace Operations including UNPKO and other military activities to maintain peace. Particularly in case of Japan, the issue of the right to collective self-defense has always been argued in connection to the dispatch of the Self-Defence Forces outside Japan.

He also supports extending the norms against nuclear weapons, and in that regard appeals to States that possess nuclear weapons to affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Finally, he proposes preparing for a world free of nuclear weapons through a number of risk -reduction measures, including transparency in nuclear-weapon programmes, further reductions in all types of nuclear weapons, commitments not to introduce new and destabilizing types of nuclear weapons, including cruise missiles, reciprocal commitments for the non-use of nuclear weapons and reduction of the role of nuclear weapons in security doctrines. We will discuss how international community, particularly the nuclear weapon states, can embark on a new stage of nuclear disarmament and what role should the United Nations and its member states, including Japan, play to promote this extraordinarily difficult political task. We will also discuss pros and cons to the Treaty on the Prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW), which entered into force on 22 January 2021.  <br /><br />Reading materials: <br /><br />Home Page of the Office for Disarmament Affairs, United Nations https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/<br /><br />\"SECURING OUR COMMON FUTURE\", An Agenda for Disarmament, Office for Disarmament Affairs<br />New York, 2018<br /><br />https://s3.amazonaws.com/unoda-web/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sg-disarmament-agenda-pubs-page.pdf#view=Fit<br />https://unoda-epub.s3.amazonaws.com/i/index.html?book=sg-disarmament-agenda.epub<br /><br />\"Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\" http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/tpnw/text<br /><br />Note: Students are expected to read materials to be provided by the speaker and prepare proper questions (A4 1apge).", "Students are expected to spend 2-3 hours’ preparations before the seminar and come prepared for discussion."], "授業外学習2": "Students are expected to undertake preliminary reading of assigned books or articles as well as any publications of their own choice."}, "評価": {"0": "", "1": ["", ""], "2": ["", ""], "3": ["", ""], "4": ["", ""], "5": ["", ""], "6": ["", ""], "7": ["", ""], "8": ["", ""], "9": ["", ""], "10": ["", ""], "11": ["", ""], "12": ["", ""], "13": ["", ""], "14": ["", ""], "15": "", "教科書Required texts0": "EURASIA GROUP’S TOP RISKS FOR 2024\nhttps://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2024", "参考文献・資料Reference books0": "Henry Kissinger, \"World Order\", Penguin Books Limited,2014\nMichael Pillsbury, “The Hundred-Year Marathon China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower”\nSt. Martin’s Griffin, 2015", "学位授与の方針との関連Relationship to Diploma Policy0": "各授業科目は、各学部・研究科の定めるディプロマ・ポリシー（DP）・カリキュラム・ポリシー（CP）に基づき、カリキュラム上に配置されています。\nDP・CPを意識して本授業科目の学修を進めることで、各学部・研究科の期待する能力が養成されます。\n各学部・研究科のDP、CPや教育課程表（授業科目一覧等）は、下記リンクこちらに掲載していますので学修計画の参考にしてください。\nhttps://kwic.kwansei.ac.jp/cabinet/reference?typeCd=0&cabinetId=557&directLink=1\n※kwicへのリンクとなります（在学生のみ閲覧可）", "成績評価Grading0": ["種別　Type備考　Note", "割合　Percentage", "評価基準等　Grading Criteria etc."], "成績評価Grading1": ["平常リポート／Individual reports (04)", "100 %", "final report (80%), class presentation (20%)"], "成績評価Grading2": "備考　Note\nStudents are requested to draft a final report on one of the designated topics provided by the instructors (80%).
