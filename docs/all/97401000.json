{"履修期": "春学期後半", "主な教授言語": "英語", "授業目的": "<span style=\"font-size:13.28px;\">Are you interested in becoming an entrepreneur or an innovative manager (an intrapreneur)? Are you curious about how dynamic technological innovation has shaped competitive conditions in markets and industries? Are you interested in exploring how dynamic technological innovation, societal, cultural, economic and political forces interact to generate the world we live in and where human kind is going in the future? This course will examine from the perspective of practicing managers and entrepreneurs the impact that technology and technological innovation has on the competitive context of organizations and how strategy must incorporate this impact. This course will also provide an opportunity to explore the relationships between the management of a business and the management of technological innovation; of the scientific quest for knowledge and the technological use of knowledge; and of the firm as an instrument of technological change in the broader context of society. Further we examine the role of entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs as leaders and entrepreneurship in fostering technological innovation and contrast and compare that role with established incumbent firms. We will accomplish these tasks through the use of hands on decision making through computer simulations of innovative environments, living cases presented by currently practicing manages (based on schedule availability) and traditional cases where you will experience the challenges of creating the future through entrepreneurship and technological innovation.</span>", "到達目標": "<span style=\"font-size:13.28px;\">Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to demonstrate the following learning outcomes: 1) Identify key elements of entrepreneurship, technology and innovation. 2) Analyze the relationship between entrepreneurs and incumbent firms in fostering technological innovation. 3) Understand the role of entrepreneurs and mangers in incumbent firms in generating technological innovation and in particular students should be able to self-reflect on their own abilities to be effective entrepreneurs. 4) Be able to think critically and laterally and express coherently that thinking both verbally and in written form. 5.) Have experienced hands on decision-making in environments characterized by uncertainty and dynamic innovation.</span>", "特記事項": "", "関連科目": "", "授業の概要・背景": "", "授業方法": "<span style=\"font-size:13.28px;\">Face to face format: The course will be taught with a combination of computer simulation, living cases (based on schedule availability), lectures, and traditional case analyses and student presentations and other in-class simulations.</span>", "トピック": {"第1回": ["<span style=\"font-size:13.28px;\">1.Introduction to the course and lecture on technology, innovation and entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship.</span>", "<span style=\"font-size:13.28px;\">Students must read and prepare the cases according to assigned questions and assigned readings before class.
