How does an economy (nation) as whole works? Understanding the answers to these questions guide us to make rational decisions in personal, social as well as professional affairs. That is why learning economics is readily useful and fun. This course introduces the principles of economics that are fundamentally important to manage the scarce resources at the individual, household, firm, and national level. The course covers both microeconomicsーthat focuses on the part of the economy, such as individuals, families, business firms, and industries, and macroeconomicsーthat analyze the economy as a whole, such as the growth of national production, unemployment, and inflation.", "授業方法": "Students will receive the required readings one week before and the lecture notes after each session.
